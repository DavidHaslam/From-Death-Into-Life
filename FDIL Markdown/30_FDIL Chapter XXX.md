It was time now to be returning southward and homeward which I did by several stages, stopping to preach in various places on the way. At length, I reached the village in Cornwall, where my family were lodging in the farmhouse I have already mentioned.

Here, the two clergymen were rather afraid of me, and avoided asking me to preach in the church. They had both been converted (or, at least, so they said) more than a year but instead of working for God, they were bent on Romanizing. One of them said that there was no salvation in the Church of England and the other showed me a sealed letter he had in his desk, which, he said, he ‘dared not open’. It was from a brother of his, who went to Rome, and contained his reasons for so doing. ‘Ah,’ he said, ‘if I open that letter, I feel sure that I shall have to go too.’ This fascinating dread was upon him till he really did go, six months afterwards. I tried to deter these men from the erroneous step they were contemplating, by getting them into active work for the Lord. Sometimes I preached in this church, but more often in the open air. I am sorry to say my friends were but half-hearted in their cooperation, so that after a few weeks I left, and went to the west.

On my way thither, a clergyman, who happened to be inside the coach, gave me his card, and then came outside for the purpose of talking with me. He asked me if I would take charge of his church and parish for six weeks.

I said I would, but could not do so for a week or two. We agreed as to time, and on the promised Saturday I arrived’ at the place.

I walked there from a neighbouring town, having several calls to make on the way, and left my luggage to follow by the van. In the evening, about eight o’clock, I went down to meet this conveyance, and tell the man where to deliver my bag. I found a crowd of people in front of the inn where the van stopped, and heard the driver say, in reply to some question, ‘I’ve not got him, but I’ve got his bag.’ ‘Where is he?’ said a voice. ‘I don’t know,’ one said, ‘but I saw a queer little chap go into Mrs. M’s house.’ ‘That’s the place,’ said the driver ‘that’s where I’m agoing to take his bag. Come on, and let’s see if he’ll have it.’

I went in and out amongst the crowd, as it was dark, asking questions, and found out that they ‘would like to duck the fellow if they could catch him’ they ‘did not want any such Revivalist chap as that amongst them,’ and so forth. They were greatly excited, and wondered which road he was likely to come, for they would go to meet him. Some one asked, ‘What is he like?’ One answered, ‘Oh, he is a rum-looking little fellow that stoops. I should know him again anywhere.’ Hearing this, I held up my head like a soldier, in order to look as large as possible, and waited about till they dispersed.

Then I joined a young man, and, talking with him, ascertained what it was all about. I passed the house where I was to lodge, for I saw that the people were watching the door. I came back among them, and, pointing to the door, said, ‘Is that where he stops?’

>‘Yes,’ one replied, ‘he is there. The man brought his bag and left it he is there, sure enough.’

I said, ‘Let us go in and see him come along―come!’ So saying. I made for the door and knocked, beckoning to the others to follow me but they would not do so. As soon as the door was opened I went in, and the landlady speedily closed it after me, saying, ‘I am glad you are come. How did you manage to get here? I have sent word to the constable to look out for you, and he is still watching somewhere.’

>‘Why,’ I asked, ‘what is it all about? What is the matter?’

>‘Why some of the lads here say, that if they could catch you, they would give you a good ducking in the pond.’

>‘Indeed!’ I said. ‘Then I don’t think I will give them that pleasure tonight.’

So, sitting down by the fire I made myself comfortable, and after supper went to bed.

In the morning, while at breakfast, I saw a number of men playing in the open space in front of the house. Some were tossing pence, some playing at ball and other games, while many were standing about smoking, with their hands in their pockets.

>‘There, that’s the way they spend their Sundays in this place,’ said the landlady.

After watching them from the window for a little time, I put on my hat and went out, and told them ‘it was time to go home and get ready for church that would be far better,’ I said, ‘than playing like this on Sunday. It is a disgrace to men like you―married men, too, with families! It would be bad enough if you were a parcel of boys. I am quite ashamed of you!’

They slunk away one by one, and I walked down the street to look about me, and to see the schoolroom, where there was no school but I intended to have a prayer meeting there in the evening, after the service. I put up a notice to this effect, and then came back to my lodgings, till it was near church-time, when I set out, arrayed in my gown and bands, for the sacred edifice.

On the way there I observed stones flying past me in every direction but I walked on, till at last I was struck on the cheek with a patch of muddy clay which was thrown at me. There was an universal shout of laughter when the men and boys saw that I had been hit. I put my hand to the place, and found that the pat of clay was sticking to my cheek, so I pressed it there, hoping, by the help of my whiskers, that it would remain. I said to the crowd, who were laughing at me, ‘That was not a bad shot. Now, if you come to church you shall see it there I will keep it on as long as I can.’ So saying, I walked on amidst the jeers of the people.

When I arrived at the vestry, the clerk was in great trouble when he knew what had happened. He said, ‘Do let me wash the mud off, sir.’ ‘Oh, no,’ I replied, ‘I mean to show that all day, if I can.’

During the morning service, at which there were about fifty people present, I succeeded in keeping on my mud-patch, and returned to dinner with the same.

In the afternoon I said that I would have a service for children, as there was no Sunday school, to which about twenty came. Before addressing them, seeing that they were intently looking at the patch on my cheek, I told them how it came there, and that I intended to keep it on all through the evening service.

This news spread over the whole place, and the consequence was that such numbers of people came out of curiosity, that the church was filled to overflowing. I preached without any reference to what had taken place, and succeeded in gaining the attention of, the people so that after the service I said I would have a prayer-meeting in the schoolroom. We had the place crammed, and not a few found peace. I announced that I would preach again the next evening.

A revival soon broke out in that place, and the crowds who came to the meetings were so great, that we had as many people outside the large schoolroom as there were in.

At the end of the six weeks the new vicar returned, and I was able to hand over the parish to him, with a full church, three Bible-classes, and a large Sunday-school. This I did, thanking God for the measure of success and blessing He had given to my efforts in that populous and wicked place.

After I had left I received a letter from some of the parishioners, asking me what I should like to have as a testimonial of their gratitude and regard that they had had a penny collection amongst themselves, which amounted to several pounds, and now they were waiting to know what I should like!

I wrote to tell them that nothing would please me better than a service of plate for communion with the sick. They bought this, and had a suitable inscription engraved, and then placed it under a glass shade in the Town Hall, on a certain day for inspection. Hundreds of people came to see the result of their penny contribution. After this public exhibition, the communion service was sent to me with a letter, written by a leading man in the place, saying, ‘I was one of the instigators of the opposition to your work here but the very first evening you spoke in the schoolroom I was outside listening, and was shot through the window. The word hit my heart like a hammer, without breaking a pane of glass. Scores and scores of people will bless God to all eternity that you ever came amongst us.’

The revival in this proverbially wicked place, created such a stir that the newspapers took it up, and thought for once that I ‘was in the right place, and doing a good work!’ The member for the borough sent me twenty-five pounds, ‘begging my acceptance of the trifle.’ Who asked him, or why he sent it, I do not know but the Lord knew that we needed help. More than this, the vicar of the adjoining parish, who used to be very friendly with me in my unconverted days, but who had declared his opposition pretty freely since that time, sent me a letter one Sunday morning by private hand, to be delivered to me personally. This I duly received but expecting that it was one of his usual letters, and also knowing that I had visited some persons in his parish who were anxious, I thought I would not open it till Monday, so placed it on the mantel-piece. A friend who happened to come in, noticing it there, said, ‘I see you have a letter from the Prebendary I dare say he is angry with you.’

>‘I suppose he is,’ I said ‘but it will keep till to-morrow and I do not care to be troubled with his thoughts to-day.’

>‘Oh, do let me open it,’ said my visitor ‘I shall not be here to-morrow, and I should so like to hear what he has to say.’

With my consent he opened it and read, ‘Dear old Haslam, you have done more good in that part of my parish where you are working, in a few weeks, than I have done for years. I enclose you a cheque for the amount of tithes coming from there. The Lord bless you more and more! Pray for me!’

It was a cheque for thirty-seven pounds. The next morning I went over to see my old friend newly-found, and to thank him in person for his generous gift. Poor man, I found him very low and depressed, and quite ready and willing that I should talk and pray with him. I sincerely hope that he became changed before I left the neighbourhood, but I never heard that he declared himself.

By this time, while I was still in Tregoney, Mr. Aitken had found his way to the village where my family were lodging, and he was preaching at the church with his usual power and effect. Night after night souls were awakened and saved. The vicar’s wife was in a towering rage of opposition. Poor woman! she declared that she ‘would rather go to Rome than be converted’ and to Rome she went, but remained as worldly as ever.

It matters very little whether unconverted people join the Church of Rome or not they are sure to be lost for ever if they die in their unconverted state for nothing avails for eternal salvation but faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
