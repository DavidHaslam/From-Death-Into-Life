## Dreams And Visions

### 1851-4

During the revival, the outpouring of the Spirit of God was very manifest and unmistakable and was seen in various ways. It was not, of course, by power or might of men, but by divine influence, that souls were awakened to see themselves in their true condition. The candle of the Lord was lighted, and there was a searching of and for immortal souls, as typified by our blessed Lord in the parable of the lost piece of silver.

We read, that the woman with her lighted candle discovered her treasure so the Divine Spirit, by awakening and searching hearts, found souls, though they had been buried under sins, worldliness, and neglect, and that for many years. It was astonishing to hear persons who had been dull and silent before, break out into full and free expression of spiritual truth and their liberty and power in prayer were not less remarkable. It was truly an opening of eyes to see, and ears to hear, and hearts to understand - a raising of the dead to spiritual life and animation. It was as wonderful as the speaking of tongues on the day of Pentecost, with this difference - that those people spoke what they knew, in tongues they had not known and these, in their own speech, declared things which they had never seen or known before.


We had another distinctive sign of Pentecost, which was, that while believers rejoiced with overflowing joy, and sinners were pricked to the heart, and cried out, ‘What must I do to be saved?’ there were those who mocked, saying, ‘These men are mad, or drunk.’ But, as St. Peter testified long ago, these men women, and children were not drunk, but under the influence and power of the Holy Ghost.


We had yet another sign. The prophet Joel. predicted, ‘It shall come to pass that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit’ (Joel ii. 28, 29). And I think my narrative would be very incomplete, and I should be holding back the truth, if I did not tell of some of the dreams and visions which continually happened at this time amongst us.

Every week almost every day, we heard of some remarkable dream or striking vision. Such things may be called ‘superstitions’ by incredulous people, but I merely state what actually took place without attempting to explain or account for it. My own feeling is, that I would rather be among the superstitious than the incredulous for I think that the former lose nothing by believing, and the latter gain nothing by their unbelief.

Among the people who are alive to spiritual realities these remarkable tokens are not suspected or doubted. To believe nothing but what you can understand or account for, is to believe nothing at all. Cornish people at that time - and ,they may still be the same - lived in a spiritual atmosphere, at least in their own county so much so, that I have often heard them complain when they returned from the ‘shires’, of the dryness and deadness they felt there. I can certainly set my seal to this testimony, and declare that those of us who had visions in Cornwall have not had them in the same way out of that district.


I will give a few specimens, but only one of a kind, for it would fill the volume if I told all the reader can judge if there was meaning or import in some of them or not.


At one time, when there was a depression or check in the congregation, and preaching was hard, praying formal, and singing flat, I invited the people to join with me in prayer, that the Lord would show us what was the hindrance in the way of the work. They prayed with one accord, and without consulting one another, almost in the same words, whether in the school-room or in the cottages the substance of their petition was, that we might know and put away the obstacle to spiritual blessing, whatever that obstacle might be.

One night I dreamt that I was in the church, feeling very desolate and forsaken there were very few people there, but soon my eyes lighted on an ugly-looking stranger, who tried to evade me. He was a very disagreeable, sullen-looking man. When I spoke to him he gnashed his teeth, and as I approached he drew out a knife and held it out before me. I pursued him notwithstanding, when he backed towards the door and went out. I followed him through the churchyard till he was outside the lych-gate. As soon as he was gone, I saw a troop of happy people, all dressed in white, come in at the same gate, leaping and running, like so many joyful children, and swinging their arms for gladness they went into the church and began to sing. The dream was as vivid to me as a daylight scene.

I went out the next evening, intending to tell it at the school-room meeting but before I began to do so, I observed that the people sang more freely than usual, and I also noticed that two men who prayed omitted to offer the usual request for hindrances to be removed. When I told my dream, a man arose and said, ‘I know all about that there has been one among us whom we thought was a good man, but instead of this we have discovered that he was most immoral and deceitful, doing a deal of mischief, secretly undermining the faith of some, and misleading others he has been detected, and is gone.’ Sure enough our old happy freedom returned, and there was liberty in preaching, praying, and singing, and souls were saved.


Another time, when I was getting a little impatient with the people, I took a leaf out of my Scripture-reader’s book, and preached a furious sermon about ‘damnation’, representing God as pursuing the sinner to cut him down, if he did not repent there and then. I thought I had done it well, and went home rather satisfied with myself, supposing that I now knew how to make the congregation feel. The next morning, a woman called to me as I was passing her cottage, and said, ‘Master, what d’yer think? I dreamt last night that the devil was a-preaching in your pulpit, and that you were delighted at it!’ A sudden fear fell upon me - so much so, that I returned to the church, and shutting the door, begged God’s forgiveness and thanking Him for this warning, asked that I might remember it, and never transgress again.

As my Scripture-reader continued to denounce wrath and vengeance, instead of preaching the Gospel, I parted with him.


Next, let me tell of a vision which refers to others. My sister came to me one morning, and said, ‘William, I had a vision last night of a young man in a tall hat, with a green-and-red carpet-bag in his hand. I saw him so plainly, that I should know him again anywhere. He was walking up the road when you met him, shook hands, and returned with him to the house. Then you and F---- brought him in at the glass door. On the hall table there stood a basket containing four beautiful and fragrant fruits. You took up the basket and offered it to the visitor, who, putting his hand upon one, said, “Oh, thank you!” then touching the three others in order, said, “That is for mother, and that for sister, and that for ----.” I could not hear who. You may smile,’ she continued, ‘but I heard that, and saw it all as plainly as I see you now.’

I was accustomed to hear such things, and consequently thought no more about it, but went on to speak of other subjects. In the course of the afternoon, as I was going out, I met a relative coming along the road, and took him back with me to the house there my wife came out to him, and we led him in through the glass door. When he had sat some time, and had had some luncheon, my wife said, ‘I wonder whether this is the young man we heard about this morning?’ ‘What young man?’ asked our visitor, hastily ‘what young man do you mean?’ ‘I should not wonder if it is,’ I replied ‘we will see presently.’ He seemed very suspicious, having heard before he came that some mysterious change had taken place in us, and so looked again and again to see if he could detect anything different.

>‘Come and see my sister,’ I said to which he assented, and we went across to her house. As soon as we entered her room, she said, ‘How do you do? I saw you last night.’ ‘What do you mean?’ he replied, withdrawing his hand. ‘Why, I was on board the steamer last night.’  ‘That may be,’ she said, ‘but you are the gentleman I saw. Have you not a green-and-red carpet-bag? and did not William meet you on the road?’ Poor young man! he looked dreadfully perplexed. ‘Never mind her’ I said ‘sit down and tell us about your journey.’

After we had talked of this and other subjects, we returned home. I then told him that we were converted, and asked if he had given his heart to God. He said he had. Not being satisfied, I put the question in another form, and yet remained unsatisfied with his answer. ‘Do you doubt me?’ he asked ‘I will prove it to you.’ He then went up to his room for a little while, and returned with a paper in his hand, in which was a dedication of himself to God, duly signed and sealed. I had never seen an instrument of this kind before, and asked if he really believed in it?

>‘Yes, certainly,’ he replied ‘and I mean it, too.’

>‘But,’ I said, ‘do you not see that faith does not consist in believing what you write, but in what God has written? The Word says that God is more willing to take than you are to give you believe you have given but do you believe that God has taken? He is far more ready to take your heart than you to give it as surely as you have given, so surely He has taken. Cannot you see that?’

>He replied, ‘I knew that there was something wrong about this, but did not know what. Thank you! thank you!’ Then thoughtfully folding up the paper, he went out of the room.

The bell was rung for dinner, but he did not appear and then for tea, but he declined taking any. After we had gone to church, he found his way down and followed us there and when the service was over, he returned again to his room. I was detained at the schoolroom that night, and until two o’clock in the morning, praying and talking with anxious souls, and returned home very tired. Going up to bed, I saw a light shining under my visitor’s door, and hesitating there a few moments, I heard him pleading earnestly for mercy. I had a great mind to knock, but was afraid of disturbing him so I prayed for him, and went to bed.

In the morning he came down smiling. ‘Thank God,’ he said, ‘it is all right now I am saved.’ In his hand he held three letters - one to his mother, one to his sister, and the other to a cousin, in which he invited them earnestly to come to Jesus. Within the week all four were in our house, praising God for salvation.

As the vision indicated, we had nothing to do but hold the basket to him. He accepted it, and the fruit for himself and his relatives.


Amongst other people and characters I met with at this time was a good, respectable man who had a remarkable dream. He came to me one day, after I had been speaking about Jacob’s ladder, and said that my sermon had reminded him of his dream. I begged him to sit down and tell it to me. He said, ‘I dreamt that I and nineteen other young men were living in a beautiful house and place, where we had everything provided for us, and were free to enjoy ourselves as much as we pleased.’ We all understood that the premises belonged to Satan, and that we were his guests. As such, we were permitted to take our pleasure upon two conditions - one was, that we were not to pray and the other, that we were not to go away. We smiled at this, and said it was not likely we should do the former, for we were not of the praying kind and less likely that we should do the latter, for why should we be such fools as to forego or give up our enjoyments?’

I thought to myself, What a wonderful dream that is and how true to reality! What numbers of young men there are, and young women too, besides many older people, who hold their worldly happiness on this tenure, and of course from the same master.

Well, to continue the story of the dream, he said, ‘In the course of time we all became heartily tired of the place and its pleasures, and longed to get away, but we could not. One of us made an attempt to do so, but he was captured and brought back, and made more of a slave than ever. At last, I and a few others agreed to pray at a stated time in different places, in the hope that if one was caught, yet the rest might escape. Upon a set day and time we began praying, each in his appointed place. I had fixed upon a dark corner in a large deserted room, where we had stowed away bales and bales of goods we did not care to open. Climbing over the top of these stores, I landed on the other side, and went to the spot I had chosen. I had not prayed long before I heard master coming, cracking his whip, and saying, “I’ll teach you to pray.” This made me tremble exceedingly, and pray all the harder but hearing that he was very near and coming after me, I opened my eyes, and to my surprise there was a beautiful silver ladder before me. As quick as thought, I sprang with hands and feet upon it, and began to climb for dear life. “Ha!” said master, “I’ll teach you to climb.” Then I felt the ladder shaking under me, and knew that he was coming up. I expected every moment to be seized and dragged back, so I climbed all the faster, and looked up to see how much farther I had to go. Oh, it was such a long way, and there was only a very small hole to get to at last. My heart began to fail me, so that I almost let go my hold, till I felt the master’s sulphurous breath on the back of my neck, which made me rush forward more vehemently. At last I reached the top, and thrust my arm through the hole, then my head, and then my other arm thus I got through altogether, leaving my old enemy blaspheming and cursing down below. It was a most beautiful place that I was now in, and angels were flying about, just as the birds do in this world. I saw the Lord Himself, and fell down before him to give Him thanks. As I remained a long time prostrate, He said to me, “What is thy petition?” I answered, “Lord, grant that that hole may be made larger, for I have nineteen friends down there in the power of the cruel master.” The Lord smiled, and said, “That hole is quite large enough.” So I awoke.’

Where there is a will, there is always a way of some kind and if worldings are really tired of Satan’s service, they can easily call upon God to deliver them, and He will most surely do so when He sees they are in earnest. This dream had the effect of spiritually awakening the man who had it, and of bringing him to the foot of the cross for mercy and salvation.

I noticed that in dreams and visions in Cornwall the Lord Jesus very often appears, and the devil also these are real persons to the Cornish mind, and their power is respectively acknowledged.


During the summer, a young gentleman, whom we invited to our house in the hope of reaching his soul, came to stay with us and this in spite of his avowed prejudice against us and our proceedings. I took this as a token of encouragement, for I was sure that the devil would have hindered his coming, unless the young man had been constrained by a higher power. He spent his time in riding about or smoking, and made great fun of our meetings and services, though I observed that he was very attentive to hear the sermon whenever he did come.

One week-day evening, while we were sitting in the drawing-room, and little expecting it he burst into tears, and cried out, ‘I don’t know what to do I shall be lost for ever!’ We immediately sprang up to his help, always delighted at such opportunities of working for the Lord. We knelt down to pray, and as we continued to do so, he fell into great distress, and even agony of soul he literally writhed as if in excessive pain, too great for utterance, and looked as if he was fainting with the struggle. We called all the servants into the room to help in prayer, and while I was praying by the side of my young friend, and pointing him to Christ, one of the servants rose up and walked straight across the room, and, with a firm hand pushing me aside, said, ‘The Lord is here Himself.’ I rose instantly and moved out of the way, while she stood with her hands together, adoring.

She afterwards told us that she saw the Lord stoop down to the low chair where my young friend was kneeling, and putting His hand on his head, He said something, and then stood up. Immediately upon this she saw the verandah crowded with ugly looking devils, all with their eyes fixed on the young man as he knelt. The Lord then waved His hand, and the ugly company vanished. At that instant the young man lifted up his head, and turning towards the side on which she had discerned the Lord as standing, said, ‘Lord, I thank Thee,’ and then fainted away.

When the vision was over, the servant came, with tears in her eyes, to ask pardon for so rudely pushing me aside, but said that while the Lord was there she could not help herself. ‘Oh, He is so beautiful, so grand!’ The young man was soon restored to animation, and began to speak in a voice and tone very different to his former utterance. He was altogether a remarkable instance of a change of heart and life.


One more case I will relate, with its solemn end, and then proceed with my narrative.

A careless, worldly man in my parish dreamt one night that he was in the market hall of a certain town. He was surprised to see, in a wall, a doorway, which he had never noticed before - so much so, that he went forward to examine it, and found ‘that it really was a door, and that it opened to his touch. He went inside, and there he saw an impressive and strange scene. There were a number of men and women walking about, who appeared to be very woeful, and in great agony of pain. They were too distressed to speak, but he recognized most of them as persons who had been dead some time. They looked mournfully at him, as if sorry that he had come there, but did not speak. He was much alarmed, and made his way back to the door to escape, but was stopped by a stern, sullen looking porter, who said, in a sepulchral voice ‘You cannot pass.’ He said, ‘I came in this way, and I want to go out’ ‘You cannot,’ said the solemn voice. ‘Look, the door opens only one way you may come in by it, but you cannot go out.’ It was so, and his heart sank within him as he looked at that mysterious portal. At last the porter relented, and as a special favour let him go forth for eight days. He was so glad at his release that he awoke.

When he told me the dream I warned him, and begged him to give his heart to God. ‘You may die,’ I said ‘before the eighth day.’ He laughed at the idea, and said he was ‘not going to be frightened by a dream.’ ‘When I am converted,’ he continued, ‘I hope I shall be able to say that I was drawn by love, and not driven by fear’ ‘But what,’ I said, ‘if you have been neglecting and slighting God’s love for a long time, and He is now moving you with fear to, return to Him?’ Nothing would do he turned a deaf ear to every entreaty. When the eighth day arrived, being market day, he went to the hall as usual, and looked at the wall of which he had dreamed with particular interest, but seeing no door there, he exclaimed, ‘It’s all right now I will go and have a good dinner over it, with a bottle of wine.’

Whether he stopped at one bottle or not. I cannot tell but late on Saturday night, as he was going home he was thrown from his horse and killed. That was at the end of the eighth day.

Whether these dreams and visions were the cause or effect of the people’s sensitive state, I do not know but certainly they were very impressible, and even the cold and hardened amongst them were ready to hear about the mysteries of the unseen world. I attributed this to the spiritual atmosphere in which they were then living.
