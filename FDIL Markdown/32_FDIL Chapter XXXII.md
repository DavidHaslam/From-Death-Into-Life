### 1857―8

While meditating upon my present position, and wondering what I was to do next, I received an invitation to take charge of a district in another part of the county, near the sea, which suited my health. Here there was a large population, which gave scope for energetic action and, moreover, the people were careless and Godless, and, as such, were not preoccupied with other systems. So I thought it was the very place in which I could begin to preach, and go on to prove the power of the Gospel.

With the invitation, I received an exaggerated account of the wickedness of the people, and was told that the thinking part of them leant towards infidelity, and that some of them were actually banded together in an infidel club. All this, however, did not deter me from going, but rather stirred me up so much the more to try my lance against this gigantic foe. I had learned before now to regard all difficulties in my work as the Lord’s, and not mine and that, though they might be greater than I could surmount, they were not too great for Him.

There were two large iron factories here, besides shipping. Many of the people employed were drawn from other parts of England, and were what the Cornish call ‘foreigners.’ They had no love for chapel services, or revivals, and no sympathy with Cornish views and customs so not having a church to go to, they were left pretty much to themselves.

With this attractive sphere before me, I gave up my living and work in the country, and accepted the curacy at £120 a year, with a house lent free. My rector was a dry Churchman, who had no sympathy with me but he seemed glad to get any one to come and work amongst such a rough, and in some respects unmanageable, set. He had bought a chapel from the Primitive Methodists for Divine service, and had erected schools for upwards of three hundred children. These he offered me as my ground of operation, promising, with a written guarantee, that if I succeeded, he would build me a church, and endow it with all the tithes of that portion of the parish.

Here was a field of labour which required much prayer and tact, as well as energetic action. In accordance with Scriptural teaching, ‘I determined to know nothing but Jesus Christ and Him crucified.’ I made up my mind that I would not begin by having temperance addresses, for drunkards, or lectures on the Evidences of Christianity for the infidel, but simply with preaching the Gospel.

One thing that simplified my work very much was the fact, that the people were spiritually dead. I used to tell them, that in this free country every man is accounted innocent till he is proved to be guilty, but that in the Bible every man is guilty before God till he is pardoned, and dead till he is brought to life. In one sense it does not matter very much whether a man is an infidel, a drunkard, or anything else, if he is dead in trespasses and sins. It is of very little consequence in what coloured raiment a corpse is shrouded it remains a corpse still. 

Taking this position positively, I avoided much religious controversy, to the disappointment of many eager disputants who longed to ventilate their views. I told them plainly, that whether they were right or wrong, my business was with the salvation of souls, and my one desire was to rescue the lost by bringing them to Christ.

Hitherto I had been to places where the Lord had previously prepared the hearts of the people, and therefore it had been my joy to see a revival spring up, as if spontaneously that is, without the ordinary preparation by the people of the place. These were extraordinary manifestations of God’s power and love and they showed me what He could and would do. Now that I was somewhat more intelligent on the subject, He sent me forth to prepare and work for similar results.

Hayle was to all appearance a very barren soil, and the people I had to labour amongst were greater and mightier than myself. They already had possession of the ground, and were perfectly content with their own way. Moreover, they did not desire any change, and were ready even to resist and oppose every effort which was designed to ameliorate their condition, or to change their lives. In this undertaking I knew and understood that without prayer and dependence upon God to work in me and by me, my mission would be altogether unavailing. I therefore looked about, and found some Christians who consented to unite in pleading for an outpouring of the Holy Spirit. We agreed to pray in private, and also met together frequently during the week for united prayer. Finding that many of the petitions offered were vague and diffuse, I endeavoured to set before, those assembled a definite object of prayer. I told them that the work was not ours but the Lord’s, and that He was willing and ready to accomplish it, but that He must be inquired of concerning the work of His hands. Also, in order that our prayers should be intelligent and united, I put before them the fact that the people we had to work amongst were lost not that they would be lost by-and-by if they died in their sins but that they were actually lost now. It is true that many were quite ignorant of the way of salvation, and were also unconscious of the power of the enemy who held them captive and besides, they loved their captivity too well but all this would be overcome in a moment, when they were once enlightened by the Spirit (in answer to prayer) to see and feel themselves lost. No one could be more ignorant than the jailor at Philippi, but as soon as he was awakened he cried out, ‘What must I do to be saved?’ (Acts xvi. 30).

I showed them that the work we had to do was clearly set forth in Scripture (Acts xxvi, 18), and that the order in which it was to be done was also made manifest. We must not begin with giving instruction as if the people were merely ignorant but rather by awakening or opening their eyes to see that they were in a lost and ruined condition. Then they would appreciate being ‘turned from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins’ (Acts xxvi. 18). I strove earnestly to show them that until people had received forgiveness of sins, our work was not complete. We made this our definite aim, and prayed about it with clear expectation. Under the shadow and influence of this prayer, I began to preach to the people not to believe, but to awake and see their lost condition that is, to repent, that they might believe the Gospel.

At first there were very few people in my congregation, but by degrees more came, and listened attentively to the Word. After preaching for four or five Sundays, I asked the people during my sermon, what in the world they were made of for I was surprised at them! They came and listened to God’s truth, and yet did not yield themselves to Him. ‘Are you wood, leather, or stone? What are your hearts made of, that God’s love cannot touch or His Word break them.’ I then invited the anxious to remain for an after-meeting, when I said that I would converse with them more’ familiarly but they every one went away.

I returned to the vestry, feeling somewhat dejected, but still hoping for better days. As I opened the door to go home, two men ran away like frightened boys, but it was too dark for me to distinguish who they were.

That next morning it came to my mind that I must go round to the people and ask them what they were thinking about? I had done so from the pulpit now I would go from house to house and do the same. I went first to the school, and finding that several children were absent, I took their names and determined to go after them, in the hope of reaching their parents.

The first house I called at was a mistake, and yet it was not. I knocked at the door, and said, ‘Does Mrs W----- live here?’

The woman who opened it said, ‘No, she lives next door.’

I apologized for disturbing her, and was going away, when she said, ‘Will you not come in for a few minutes?’

I assented, and going in, took a seat. Then I asked her name, and whether she went to church.

She replied, ‘To be sure I do. Don’t you see me there every Sunday?’

>‘Then,’ I said, ‘did you hear my question last evening?’

>‘Yes,’ she said, ‘but I was afraid, and ashamed to stay behind. But I do wish to be saved I have been wretched for more than a week.’

It was very easy to lead to the Saviour of sinners one whose heart was so prepared. She soon found peace, and became one of my most useful and steadiest helpers.

Her neighbour next door, was by no means so ready to receive the truth, and I had to supply another argument altogether. Eventually, she also found peace in believing though not for some weeks.

From this house, I visited several others, and in all of them had serious dealing with individuals about their souls’ salvation. Then I set off to see a man I had often observed in church having noticed the anxious look with which he always regarded me during the sermon. I found him at home, and, on entering his house, he said, at once, ‘I know what you are come for. Wait a little, sir, please to sit down’ and, before I had time to say a word, he went upstairs. In a few minutes he returned, with a shilling in his hand. ‘There,’ he said, ‘there it is that is my contribution for the Indian Mutiny Fund.’

I thanked him for his offering, and promised that it should be given to the treasurer. ‘But,’ I added, ‘to tell the truth, I have not come about that, but to see you. I want to speak to you about your soul.’

He sat down, looking, as I thought, most unhappy. Then he said, ‘Last night my mate and I made up our minds to speak to you in the vestry but, just as we were coming to the door, you opened it, and we ran away.’

>‘Yes,’ I said, ‘I heard you.’

>‘Well, after that, we came home, and prayed the Lord to send you to us and here you are!’

>‘Thank God for the answer to prayer. Now then, what can I do for you?’

He told me that he was born of respectable parents in Germany but that, for his bad ways and habits, they had sent him to this country to work for his bread that he had taken the pledge several times, and broken it again and again, though he had prayed and done all he could think of but it was to no purpose.

>‘If you had stayed last night,’ I said, ‘I might have helped you. How did you come to break your pledge?’

>‘Oh,’ he said, ‘it came to my mind that when I signed, I was only thinking of beer and spirits, not wine so I took some, and it flew to my head and soon I was as bad as ever.’

>‘Now,’ I said, ‘you have renounced wine and all have you?’

>‘Yes, I have.’

>‘Well then, will you give your heart to God also?’ 

In course of conversation it came out, that this man’s first impressions were effected some years before, by a dream, or vision of Christ on the cross. He was passing by, but, somehow, turned to look at it when, to his surprise, he saw that the eyes of the figure were looking at him. As he approached, the figure appeared to be standing on the ground, and beckoning, when a sudden fear came over him he stopped, and the vision faded away. Ever since that time, he had felt that Jesus was the Friend he needed, and that nothing less would satisfy him.

Unfortunately, too many, like this man, stop at a critical point of their history and, often, the crisis is not prolonged for them, as it was for him.

A long time ago there was a sinner arrested by a similar vision. He says, in a hymn which he wrote, giving a description of it -

>‘I saw One hanging on a tree,<BR>
In agony and blood,<BR>
Who fixed His languid eyes on me<BR>
As near the cross I stood.’

He continues,

>‘My conscience felt and owned its guilt’ 

and when he did so, he received a second look, which spoke forgiveness to him, as distinctly as the first look brought him under conviction.

I charged this man to make his surrender, and to own or acknowledge himself the sinner for whom Jesus died. On doing so, he obtained forgiveness and peace, and has since, by grace, been enabled to live a happy, consistent, and devoted life, and has been a blessing to many souls. No sooner had he found the Saviour, than immediately he began to plead for and with his friend James. I know not what passed between them but that same evening he brought him to me with a heart prepared to receive Christ. We had only to point him to Jesus, and encourage him to thank God, when he realized the truth in his own experience.

So that Monday I rejoiced over five people brought to the Lord and then the work began in real earnest. Every week after that, remarkable conversions took place, besides many ordinary ones. Some of these, including the one just mentioned, are described at length in tracts, and are also published in a volume entitled ‘Building from the Top, and other Stories’ but, notwithstanding this, a brief allusion to them in this narrative may not be out of place, being so particularly connected with the work here.

A woman called me into her cottage one morning as I was passing by, and told me of her son, a steady young man, though still unconverted, for whom she had prayed continually ever since his birth. She said, when he was a very little child, she heard him one night sobbing and praying in his room―‘O Lord, save me up for a good boy!’ She thought this was an answer to her supplication but as he grew up he became thoughtless and careless, like too many others of his age.

‘Some five or six months ago,’ she said, ‘he had a dream or vision, and saw you so plainly that he pointed you out to me, among other clergymen, and said, “Mother, that man is to be our minister one day I saw him a little time ago, in a dream, as plainly as I see him now I know that is the man.” We did not know who you were then, or where you came from, and never saw you again till you came lately to this parish to be our minister.

>‘Last night,’ continued the mother, ‘after he returned from church, my William was very unhappy and restless and in the night I heard him crying and praying aloud for mercy, in great distress. He told me this morning, when I asked him about it, that he dreamt that the last day was come, and that the world was on fire and he began immediately to try to pray, but could not yet he went on trying till he heard some one laugh out at him, and say, “Ho! ho! my boy, you are too late!―ho! ho!―too late! I have got you now―you are too late!” This frightened him so much that he woke up, and getting out of bed, began on his knees to pray in earnest for the Lord to have mercy on his soul.’

Being much interested in the young man, I begged her to send him to me in the evening. She did so and when he arrived I frankly told him what I had heard about him, and particularly about his distress and prayer the night before.

>‘Your mother has prayed for you for years and when you were a little boy you prayed the Lord to save you last night, again, you were constrained to cry for mercy. These are all tokens of God’s good intentions and purposes towards you. Can you trust Him?’

As he hesitated (for so many like to feel something before they make the venture of faith), I continued, ‘These tokens are better than feelings, for they are facts and sure signs by which you may know that the Lord is calling you.’

We may well understand that it was not long before the Lord, who had so marvellously opened his eyes to see his sins, enabled him by the same Spirit to see Jesus as His Saviour, and to rejoice in the forgiveness of his sins. Then I asked him to sit down again, for I was curious to hear about the dream or vision which he had had some months before he ever saw me.

>‘William,’ I said, ‘did you ever see me before I came to this parish?’

>‘Yes,’ he replied, ‘I saw you once in a vision, more than six months ago!’

>‘Do you mind telling me about it?’

After a little hesitation, he answered, ‘I often dream things. One night I dreamt that I was walking on a wild barren common there were many bare places where people had cut turf, and there were prickly furzebushes about. I knew there were some old open mine-shafts there, for people sometimes fell into them in the night but I was walking along without thinking of danger, and was not afraid, though it was dark, and I was alone. I don’t know how long I went on like this, but next I found I was walking with you. I could see you very plainly, just as if it had not been dark, and you were talking about Jesus and His love to sinners. I liked your words very much, and was so taken up with them that I do not know when it became light for now I could see the rough common, and a path, and we were walking in it. Going along this path, we came to a wall, and I could not go any further but you walked on as if there were no wall. Presently you stopped, and, turning to me, said, “Why don’t you come on?”

>‘I answered, “I cannot.”

>‘“Why not?”

>‘“Because there is a wall here.”

>‘“No,” you said “there is no wall―it is an open door.”

>‘I was surprised at your saying that, for I could feel the wall and see it.

>‘“What would you do if there was no wall? Do that. It is not a wall, but a door,” you said, “walk on forward!”

>‘When I ventured forward I found your words were true. It was, indeed, an open way, leading into a beautiful garden. I was very happy, and said, “Whose garden is this?”

>‘You answered, “It is the Lord’s, and you are to dress it and work in it.”

>‘Then I saw the Lord Himself. He came forward, and bidding me welcome, said that you should teach me for three years. Then I awoke.’

From this extraordinary narration I gathered three things for myself.
* First, that God intended me to come to this place.
* Secondly, that I was to labour here for three years.
* Thirdly, that I was to teach the people not to wait for feelings, but to act upon the Word of God.

This last intimation was so clearly signified by William’s dream, that it came upon me with striking force. I had been speaking on this very subject more than once, and had ventured so far as to say that I thought this delusion about waiting for feelings was from the devil, to hinder the work of God in the soul. It certainly did hinder us, very much and, moreover, it was most distressing to see people, who were manifestly impressed under the power of a present God, waiting for Him because they did not feel some token, which they had set their minds upon.

Day by day souls were being given in the Church, and also in cottage meetings so that I could not help seeing that the Lord had begun to use me again. Some came to the meetings who had been awakened under the ordinary preaching of the Gospel some because others brought them and some out of curiosity. One of the latter cases I will mention. 

A married woman, N. R----- , heard people talking of the work which was going on. It seemed to her to be such a strange thing in connection with a Church minister, that she came to a cottage meeting to judge for herself, without the remotest idea of being converted. God’s ways are not as ours while she was listening, the Word reached her with power, so that she was convicted and converted, and came out of that cottage a rejoicing believer, lost in wonder, love, and praise. She was indeed strikingly and manifestly changed, and did not hide it. It was such a joy and surprise to her that she could not help telling every one. Out of the abundance of her heart her lips spoke to tell of the lovingkindness of the Lord.
