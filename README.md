# From-Death-Into-Life
The published text of “_From Death Into Life_” by William Haslam (1818-1905)

## Author
The Reverend William Haslam is often described as the “Parson converted though his own sermon”. 
* A modern biography written by Chris Wright was published in 2005 with the title “Haslam's Journey”.
* This is mainly compiled from extracts from two of his autobiographical works.
* A pensketch of [William Haslam](http://revival-library.org/index.php/pensketches-menu/evangelical-revivalists/william-haslam) is available at the Revival Library.

## Status
FDIL is in the Public Domain. It was first published in 1880.

## Markdown
The work is provided here in Markdown format with one file per chapter, etc.
* The table of **CONTENTS** is formatted as monospace to preserve column alignments.
* Page numbers therein refer to the original 1880 edition.

## Illustrations
The original work included a few illustrations. These need to be scanned and uploaded as images.

## Gutenberg
The text for FDIL at **Project Gutenberg** is eBook [#14578](http://www.gutenberg.net/1/4/5/7/14578/).
* This is based on a Canadian reprint edition by Rev. W. J. Watchorn printed by the Standard Book Room, Brockville, Ontario.
* It was digitised by Michael Madden and released on January 3, 2005. 
* This is deficient in that chapter 25 was missing and subsequent chapters were misnumbered.
* The Gutenberg text has not been corrected for OCR errors.

## Revival Library
The etext was also formerly available from the [Revival Library](http://www.revival-library.org/) maintained by Tony Cauchi.

## Modern reprints
FDIL is readily available in printed format from various suppliers, having been reprinted by several publishers since the 1960s.

My own copy is the [Adam Gordon Reprints](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1874422117/) facsimile edition published in 1994, which is now out of print.

## William Haslam online
There is a website dedicated to [William Haslam](http://williamhaslam.org) maintained by Alasdair Denton of Cardiff.

There used to be an online **Bulletin Board** too, linked to an [earlier version](https://web.archive.org/web/20110929014844/http://www.williamhaslam.org/) of the website. 

This became defunct a few years ago, but a [snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20080703192818/http://www.williamhaslam.org/board/) from 2008 still exists.

The signifcance of the **WH Bulletin Board** lies in the fact that some of the forums contain text uploads of various works by and about William Haslam. These are still accessible through the **WayBack Machine** of the **Internet Archive**.

## About myself
Although my surname is Haslam, I have not been able to establish any direct family connection with the author.
