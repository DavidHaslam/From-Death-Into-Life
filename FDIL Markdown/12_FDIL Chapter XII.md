## Billy Bray

### 1852

After the events narrated in Chapter X, and when all the people who dwelt on the hill on which the church was built were converted, there came upon the scene a very remarkable person, who had evidently been kept back for a purpose. This was none other than the veritable and well-known ‘BILLY BRAY’. One morning, while we were sitting at breakfast, I heard some one walking about in the hall with a heavy step, saying, ‘Praise the Lord! praise the Lord!’ On opening the door, I beheld a happy-looking little man, in a black Quaker-cut coat, which it was very evident had not been made for him, but for some much larger body.

>‘Well, my friend,’ I said, ‘Who are you?’

>‘I am Billy Bray,’ he replied, looking steadily at me with his twinkling eyes ‘and be you the passon?’

>‘Yes, I am.’

>‘Thank the Lord! Converted, are ye?’

>‘Yes, thank God.’

>‘And the missus inside’ (pointing to the dining-room), ‘be she converted?’

>‘Yes, she is.’

>‘Thank the dear Lord!’ he said, moving forward.

I made way for him, and he came stepping into the room then making a profound bow to the said ‘missus’, he asked, ‘Be there any maidens (servants)?’

>“Yes, there are three in the kitchen.’

>‘Be they converted too?’

I was able to answer in the affirmative and as I pointed towards the kitchen door when I mentioned it, he made off in that direction, and soon we heard them all shouting and praising God together. When we went in, there was Billy Bray, very joyful, singing,

>‘Canaan is a happy place<BR>
I am bound for the land of Canaan.’

We then returned to the dining-room with our strange guest, when he suddenly caught me up in his arms and carried me round the room. I was so taken by surprise, that it was as much as I could do to keep myself in an upright position, till he had accomplished the circuit. Then he set me in my chair, and rolling on the ground for joy, said that he ‘was as happy as he could live’. When this performance was at an end, he rose up with a face that denoted the fact, for it was beaming all over. I invited him to take some breakfast with us, to which he assented with thanks. He chose bread and milk, for he said, ‘I am only a child.’

I asked him to be seated, and gave him a chair but he preferred walking about, and went on talking all the time. He told us that twenty years ago, as he was walking over this very hill on which my church and house were built (it was a barren old place then), the Lord said to him, ‘I will give thee all that dwell in this mountain.’ Immediately he fell down on his knees and thanked the Lord, and then ran to the nearest cottage. There he talked and prayed with the people, and was enabled to bring them to Christ then he went to the next cottage, and got the same blessing and then to a third, where he was equally successful. Then he told ‘Father’ that there were only three ‘housen’ in this mountain, and prayed that more might be built. That prayer remained with him, and he never ceased to make it for years. The neighbours, who heard his prayer from time to time, wondered why he should ask for ‘housen’ to be built in such an ‘ungain’ place.

At last, after sixteen years, he received a letter from his brother James, to say that they were hacking up the ‘croft’ to plant trees, and that they were going to build a church on the hill. He was ‘fine and glad’, and praised the Lord. Again he did so, when his brother wrote to say there was a vicarage to be built on the same hill, and a schoolroom also. He was almost beside himself with joy and thankfulness for all this.

In the year 1848, when the church was completed and opened, he came on a visit to Baldhu, and was greatly surprised to see what a change had taken place. There was a beautiful church, a parsonage, with a flourishing garden, and also a schoolroom, with a large plantation and fields round them. He was quite ‘mazed’, for he never thought that the old hill could be made so grand as that! However, when he went to the service in the church, his joy was over he came out ‘checkfallen’ and quite disappointed. He told ‘Father’ that that was nothing but an ‘old Pusey’ He had got there, and that he was no good. While he was praying that afternoon, ‘Father’ gave him to understand that he had no business there yet, and that he had come too soon, and without permission. So he went back to his place at once, near Bodmin, and continued to pray for the hill.

After three years his brother James wrote again and this time it was to tell him that the parson and all his family were converted, and that there was a great revival at the church. Now poor Billy was most eager to come and see this for himself, but he obtained no permission, though he asked and looked for it every day for more than three months.

At last, one wintry and frosty night in January, about half-past eleven o’clock, just as he was getting into bed, ‘Father’ told him that he might go to Baldhu. He was so overjoyed, that he did not wait till the morning, but immediately ‘put up’ his clothes again, ‘hitched in’ the donkey, and set out in his slow-going little cart. He came along singing all the way, nearly thirty miles, and arrived early in the morning. Having put up his donkey in my stable, he came into the house, and presented himself, as I have already stated, in the hall, praising God.

We were a long time over breakfast that morning, for the happy man went on from one thing to another, ‘telling of the Lord,’ as he called it, assuring us again and again that he was ‘fine and glad, and very happy’―indeed, he looked so. He said there was one thing more he must tell us it was this―that he had a ‘preeching-house’ (what we should now call a mission-room), which he had built years ago. He had often prayed there for ‘this old mountain’, and now he should dearly love to see me in the pulpit of that place, and said that he would let me have it for my work. He went on to say that he had built it by prayer and faith, as ‘Father’ sent him help, and that he and another man had built it with their own hands. One day he was short of money to buy timber to finish the roof his mate said it would take ‘two pounds’ worth so he asked the Lord for this sum, and wondered why the money did not come, for he felt sure that he was to have it. A farmer happened to look in the next morning, and Billy thought he had come with the money, but he merely asked them what they were doing, and then took his departure, without giving them help. All that day they waited in expectation, and went home in the evening without having done any work. The next morning the same farmer appeared again, and said, ‘What do you want two pounds for?’  ‘Oh,’ said Billy, ‘you are come, are you? We want that money for the roof yonder.’ The farmer then went on to say, ‘Two days ago it came to my mind to give two pounds for the preaching house, but as I was coming down the hill on yesterday morning, something said to me, “If you give one pound it will be handsome” then I thought I would give only half-a-sovereign and then that I would give nothing. Why should I? But the Lord laid it on my mind again last night that I must give you two pounds. There it is!’

‘Thank the Lord!’ said Billy, and proceeded immediately to get the required timber. In answer to prayer he also obtained ‘reed’ for thatching the roof, and by the same means timber for the forms and seats.

It was all done in a humble manner, so that he did not dream of buying any pulpit but one day, as he was passing along the road, he saw that they were going to have a sale at the ‘count-house’ of an old mine. He went in, and the first thing which met his eye was a strong oak cupboard, with a cornice round the top. It struck him that it would make a grand pulpit, if only it was strong enough on examination, he found it all he could desire in this respect. He thought if he could take off the top and make a ‘plat’ to stand upon, it would do ‘first-rate.’ He ‘told Father’ so, and wondered how he could get it. He asked a stranger who was there, walking about. what he thought that old cupboard would go for? ‘Oh for about five or six shillings,’ was the reply. And while Billy was pondering how to ‘rise’ six shillings, the same man came up and said, ‘What do you want that cupboard for, Billy?’ He did not care to tell him, for he was thinking and praying about it. The man said, ‘There are six shillings for you buy it, if you will.’ Billy took the money. thanking the Lord, and impatiently waited for the sale. No sooner was the cupboard put up, than he called out ‘Here maister, here’s six shillin’s for un,’ and he put the money down on the table. ‘Six shillings bid,’ said the auctioneer―‘six shillings―thank you seven shillings any more for that good old cupboard? Seven shillings. Going―going -gone!’ And it was knocked down to another man.

Poor Billy was much disappointed and perplexed at this, and could not understand it at all. He looked about for the man who had given him the six shillings, but in vain―he was not there. The auctioneer told him to take up his money out of the way. He complied, but did not know what to do with it. He went over a hedge into a field by himself, and told ‘Father’ about it but it was all clear ‘Father’ was not angry about anything. He remained there an hour, and then went homewards.

As he was going along, much troubled in his mind as to this experience (for he still felt so sure he was to have that cupboard for a pulpit), he came upon a cart standing outside a public-house, with the very cupboard upon it, and some men were measuring it with a foot rule. As he came up, he heard them say, ‘It is too large to go in at the door, or the window either.’ The publican who had bought it said. ‘I wish I had not bid for the old thing at all it is too good to “scat” up for firewood.’ At that instant it came to Billy’s mind to say, ‘Here, I’ll give you six shillings for un.’ ‘Very well,’ said the man, taking the money ‘you can have him.’ Then Billy began to praise the Lord, and went on to say, ‘“Father” as good as told me that I was to have that cupboard, and He knew I could not carry him home on my back, so He has found a horse and cart for me. Bless the Lord!’ Promising to bring it back very soon, he led the horse down the hill, and put the old cupboard into the preaching-house. ‘There it is!’ he exclaimed, ‘and a fine pulpit he does make, sure enough! Now,’ said Billy, ‘I want to see thee in it. When will you come?’ I could not fix for that day, or the next, but made arrangements to conduct a series of services the next week, and promised to have them in that place.

Before he left us, he made a particular inquiry about the two other houses which had been built, who lived in them, and especially if all the ‘dwellers were converted’. Then he declared his intention to go and see the parties, and rejoice with them, and testify how fully the Lord had accomplished the promise He gave him upon that very hill, twenty years before.

According to promise, I went to Billy Bray’s preaching-house, or mission-hall. It was the first time that I had preached anywhere outside my church and schoolroom since my conversion. There it pleased the Lord to give me much help, and a great work followed, such as Billy had never seen in that place before. Several times we were detained there all night through, with penitents crying aloud for mercy, and believers rejoicing.

As a rule, the Cornish man would remain at a meeting for hours, and come again the next day, and the day after, if needful, till he felt that he could cry for mercy, and then he would begin and continue crying until he felt he could believe.

At the conclusion of these services we returned to the schoolroom, where our meetings were continued.

Our friend Billy remained with us at Baldhu, and was very useful. He spoke in the schoolroom with much acceptance and power in the simplicity of his faith, and souls were added to the Lord continually.

At this time he was very anxious for a cousin of his, a man somewhat older than himself, of the same name. This Billy was as famous for his drunkenness and dissolute habits, as the other Billy was for his faith and joy. The former used to go by the name of the ‘lost soul’. The very children in the lanes called after him, ‘Ah, Billy, you are a lost soul,’ and laughed at him. I was then in the freshness and power of my first love, and could not help regarding this pitiable object, and considering his case for I could not imagine why any man should remain unsaved and without Christ.

Accordingly, one wet morning, when I felt pretty sure that old Billy would not be out working in the field, I made my way down to his house. As I expected, he was at home in his chimney corner so setting down my dripping umbrella, I told him how glad I was to find him there, for I wanted to have a talk with him.

>‘Ah, it’s all very well for you gentlemen, who have none else to do but to go about and talk but we poor men must work.’ So saying, he rose up from his ‘settle’ and went to the door.

>‘But, Billy, it is raining quite hard you cannot work in rain like that.’

>‘Can’t help it we must do our work,’ and so he slammed the door after him and departed.

His wife made all kinds of apologies for him, because ‘he was a very singular kind of man he did not mean bad―he was “that curious”, that he said and did curious things, and that I must not mind him.’

I confess I was much disappointed at his abrupt departure from the house, but I remained a little longer, till the worst of the storm was over.

After the lapse of nearly a quarter of an hour, Billy crept back to the door, and lifting the latch quietly, whispered to his wife, ‘Is the passon gone?’

>‘No, Billy,’ I said, ‘here I am. Come in out of the wet. I am so glad you have come back.’

>‘What d’yer want with me?’ he inquired.

>‘I want to talk to you about your soul. I have been thinking much about you lately, Billy. They call you a “lost soul”.’

>‘What’s that to you?’

>‘Ah, a great deal,’ I said, ‘because I have a message for lost people. I am not a doctor for the body my business is about the soul.’

>‘I ain’t so bad as all that yet,’ he replied.

>‘But you are bad enough, Billy – bad enough.’

>‘Yes, indeed,’ interposed his wife.

>‘You hold yer tongue you’re no better.’

I beckoned to her to be still, and went on to say, ‘You are bad enough, Billy, for an old man. How old are you?’

>‘Up seventy years.’

>‘Seventy years!’ I repeated. ‘Well, now that’s a great age―that’s the age of man. Threescore years and ten! It is like giving you notice to give up the keys of the old tabernacle. I wonder why God spares your life? I am afraid you have been a cumberer of the ground all this time, Billy.  Do you know why the good Lord has spared you for so long?’

>‘I can’t tell,’ he said, getting more and more impatient.

>‘Well, do you know, I think I can tell you. He is such a loving and merciful God, He wants to have mercy on you! You could not have greater proof of it, could you? You set a horribly bad example you do nothing but drink, and smoke, and swear. You have asked God to damn your soul over and over again, and yet here you are still. Why is this?’

He did not answer, but seemed interested, so I went on to speak, of the forbearance of God towards him. I said, ‘Billy, do you know that I think the Lord wants to have mercy on you? He wants to save you!’ As he listened, I went on to tell him that God loved him, and gave His Son to die for him. Then I proceeded to speak of the wonderful patience and long-suffering of God―a kind of crown upon His love and what a shame it was to sin against such love as this.

Poor Billy looked at me with tears in his eyes, and said, ‘You are a dear man!’

>‘Dear man!’ I answered. ‘What, then, is God, if I am “dear” only for telling you of His love? Ah, Billy, take and give your heart to God at once. He is waiting for you it is a shame to refuse such a God.’

I knelt down and began to pray for him. He soon fell on his knees too, and sobbed aloud then he commenced to pray in his own way. He needed much teaching, so when he rose from his knees I said to him ‘Now. Billy, I have been to see you it is your turn to come and see me next. When will you come?’

>‘This afternoon,’ he said.

>‘Very good come this afternoon.’ And he did. More than that, this poor ‘lost soul’ found peace in my study, to his great joy and he was not ashamed to acknowledge it openly, nor afraid to praise God for His great goodness.

The same evening he stood up in the schoolroom meeting, and told the people what the Lord had done for his soul. There was great excitement that night, and well there might be, for every one knew what a daring and wicked man he had been. One man said that ‘if a corpse had come out of the churchyard and spoken, he could not have been more frightened’ (more surprised, he meant).

Old Billy’s conversion gave a new and fresh impetus to the work, and many more souls were added to the Lord.

This dear man lived for three months after this, verifying the words I was led to say to him at the beginning of our intercourse―that the Lord was keeping him alive in order to have mercy upon him. At the end of this time, his daughter came to me one morning in great haste, and said, ‘Father is dying, and does so want to see you. Will you come?’ I went immediately. On reaching his house and entering his bedroom, his wife said, ‘You are too late he is dead!” Softly I moved forward to the bed, and looking on that face, once more, I thought that I could still see signs of life. Pressing his cold hand, I spoke a few words about the loving-kindness of the Lord. He knew me, and a smile brightened his face at the precious name of Jesus. While we stood silently round his dying bed, he said (evidently in reference to what he had heard), ‘Not dead just beginning to live.’ Thus, with a sweet, triumphant smile, he departed.
