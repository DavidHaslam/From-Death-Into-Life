# The New Parish

### 1846 

About this time the news reached us that the Vicar was dead and thus ended my connection with Perranzabuloe. As the Dean and Chapter  would not appoint me to succeed, I had no alternative but to make  arrangements for my departure. 

In one sense I was not sorry to go but for various other reasons I much regretted having to leave a place where my health had been so  wonderfully restored and sustained, and in which I had received so  many tokens of God’s favour. It is true that my labours were of an  external character but these I thought most important, and did them  with all my might as unto the Lord. I took the work as from Him, and  did it all to Him, and for Him, thanking Him for any token of success  or commendation which I received. 

I also regretted leaving the place before I had done any good to the people for, with all my endeavours, I had not succeeded in persuading  them to receive my idea of salvation by churchmanship. However, the  door was shut behind me and this crisis happened at the exact time of  another important event in my life. I was just engaged to be married,  and therefore had an additional interest in looking for a sphere of  labour which would suit me, and also the partner of my choice, who  was in every respect likely to be an effectual helpmeet. This was soon  found, and we agreed together to give ourselves to the Lord’s work (as  we thought) in it. 

One of the ‘Peel’ districts in the neighbourhood of Truro, which I had designed, called Baldhu, was on the Earl of Falmouth’s estate it came  to his lordship’s mind to take an interest in this desolate spot so he  bought the patronage from the commissioners, and then offered it to  me, to be made into a new parish. This I accepted, with many thanks,  and began immediately to dream out my plans for the future.  It was a time of great distress in that place amongst the tenants, on  account of the failure of the potato crop so his lordship employed some  hundreds of the men in breaking up the barren croft for planting trees  there he gave me a good central site for a church. 

Now I made up my mind to have everything perfect, and with my own rules and regulations, my surpliced choir, churchwardens, and  frequent services, all after my own heart, it could scarcely fail to be  otherwise. I thought that, having free scope, mine should be a model  place. The district was in a barren part of a large parish three thousand  souls had been assigned to me and I was to go and civilize them, build  my church, school-house, and, indeed, establish everything that was  necessary. 

To begin with, I took a room which was used for a village school in the week, and for a service on Sunday. This succeeded so well, that in a  few months I determined to enlarge the building in which we  assembled, as speedily as possible. Having made all necessary plans,  and procured stones, timber, and slate, we commenced operations at  five o’clock one Monday morning, and by Saturday night had a  chancel (which I thought most necessary) ready for Sunday use!  All the world came to see this sudden erection. This temporary church  now held three hundred people and with the addition of a new choir  and hearty service, it was a great success, or, at least, so I imagined, for  in those days I did not look for more. 

I entered upon my work here with renewed energy and sanguine hope. I had, of course, gained more experience in the various duties of  my ministry, and had, moreover, a clearer perception, as I thought,  how sacramental teaching, under the authority of the Church ought to  work. I preached on holy living, not conversion, for as yet I knew  nothing about the latter. 

In 1847, I went on a visit to a very remarkable man, who had a great effect upon me in many ways. He was the Rev. Robert Hawker, of  Morwenstow, in the extreme north of Cornwall. 

This friend was a poet, and a High Churchman, from whom I learned many practical lessons. He was a man who prayed, and expected an  answer he had a wonderful perception for realizing unseen things, and  took Scripture literally, with startling effect. He certainly was most  eccentric in many of his ways but there was a reality and  straightforwardness about him which charmed me very much and I  was the more drawn to him, from the interest he took in me and my  work. 

He knew many legends of holy men of old, and said ,that the patron saints of West Cornwall were in the calendar of the Eastern Church,  and those in the north of Cornwall belonged to the Western. His own  patron saint, Morwenna, was a Saxon, and his church a Saxon fane. He  talked of these saints as if he knew all about them, and wrote of them  in a volume of poems thus- 

‘They had their lodges in the wilderness, 
And built them cells along the shadowy sea 
And there they dwelt with angels like a dream, 
And filled the field of the evangelists 
With thoughts as sweet as flowers’ 

He used to give most thrilling and grand descriptions of the storms of the Atlantic, which broke upon the rocky coast with gigantic force, and  tell thrilling stories of shipwrecks how he saved the lives of some of  the sailors, and how he recovered the bodies of others he could not  save. Then, in the churchyard he would show you there, a broken boat  turned over the resting-place of some here, two oars set up crosswise  over several others and in another part the figure-head of a ship, to  mark the spot where the body of a captain was buried. 

The Vicarage house was as original as himself. Over the door was inscribed- 

>‘A house, a glebe, a pound a day <BR>
A pleasant place to watch and pray. <BR>
Be true to Church, be kind to poor, <BR>
O minister, for evermore!’ <BR>

The interior was furnished with old-fashioned heavy furniture, and the outside was conspicuous for its remarkable chimneys, which were  finished off as models of the towers of churches where he had served.  The kitchen chimney, which was oblong, perplexed him very much, till  (as he said) ‘I bethought me of my mother’s tomb and there it is, in its  exact shape and dimensions!’ 

He had daily service in his church, generally by himself, when he prayed for the people. ‘I did not want them there,’ he said. ‘God hears  me and they know when I am praying for them, for I ring the bell.’  He had much influence in his parish, chiefly amongst the poor, and  declared that his people did whatever he told them. They used to bring  a bunch of flowers or evergreens every Sunday morning, and set them  up in their pew ends, where a proper place was made to hold them.  The whole church was seated with carved oak benches, which he had  bought from time to time from other churches, when they were repewed  with ‘deal boxes’! 

On the Sunday, I was asked to help him in the service, and for this purpose was arrayed in an alb, plain, which was just like a cassock in  white linen. As I walked about in this garb, I asked a friend, ‘How do  you like it?’ In an instant I was pounced upon and grasped sternly on  the arm by the Vicar. ‘ “Like” has nothing to do with it is it right?’ He  himself wore over his alb a chasuble, which was amber on one side  and green on the other. and was turned to suit the Church seasons also  a pair of crimson-coloured gloves, which, he contended, were the  proper sacrificial colour for a priest. 

I had very little to do in the service but to witness his proceedings, which I observed with great attention, and even admiration. His  preaching struck me very much he used to select the subject of his  sermon from the Gospel of the day all through the year. This happened  to be ‘Good Samaritan Sunday’, so we had a discourse upon the  ‘certain man who went down from Jerusalem to Jericho’, in which he  told us that ‘the poor wounded man was Adam’s race the priest who  went by was the Patriarchal dispensation the Levite, the Mosaic and  the good Samaritan represented Christ the inn was the Church, and  the twopence, the Sacraments.’ 

He held up his manuscript before his face, and read it out boldly, because he ‘hated’, as he said, ‘those fellows who read their sermons,  and all the time pretended to preach them’ and he especially abhorred  those who secreted notes in their Bibles ‘Either have a book, sir, or  none!’ 

He had a great aversion to Low Church clergymen, and told me that his stag Robin, who ranged on the lawn, had the same and that once he  pinned one of them to the ground between his horns. The poor man  cried out in great fear so he told Robin to let him go, which he did, but  stood and looked at the obnoxious individual as if he would like to  have him down again and frighten him, though he would not hurt him  - ‘Robin was kind-hearted.’ 

‘This Evangelical,’ he continued, ‘had a tail coat he was dressed like an undertaker, sir. Once upon a time there was one like him travelling in  Egypt, with a similar coat and a tall hat and the Arabs pursued him,  calling him the “father of saucepans, with a slit tail.” This part of his  speech was evidently meant for me, for I wore a hat and coat of this  description, finding it more convenient for the saddle, and for dining  out when I alighted. 

He persuaded me to wear a priestly garb like his, and gave me one of his old cassocks for a pattern this I succeeded in getting made to my  satisfaction, after considerable difficulty. 

I came back to my work full of new thoughts and plans, determined to do what was ‘right’ and this in spite of all fears, whether my own, or  those of others. 

I now began to think more of the reality of prayer, and of the meaning of the services of the Church I emphasized my words, and insisted  upon proper teaching. I also paid more attention to my sermons,  having hitherto disregarded them for, as I said, ‘the Druids never  preached they only worshipped.’ 

I held up my manuscript and read my sermon, like Mr. Hawker and I wore a square cap and cassock, instead of the ‘saucepan’ and the ‘tails’.  This costume I continued to wear for several years, though I was  frequently laughed at, and often pursued by boys, which was not  agreeable to flesh and blood but it helped to separate me from the  world, and to make me feel that I was set apart as a priest to offer  sacrifice for the people. 

In course of time I began to make preparations for my permanent church. I drew the designs for it, passed them, and obtained money  enough to begin to build. There was a grand ceremony at the stonelaying.  and a long procession. We had banners, chanting, and a  number of surpliced clergy, besides a large congregation.  The Earl of Falmouth, who laid the stone, contributed a thousand  pounds towards the edifice his mother gave three hundred pounds for  a peal of bells and others of the gentry who were present contributed  so that upwards of eighteen hundred pounds was promised that day.  Just twelve months after, July 20, 1848, the same company, with many  others, and the Bishop of Exeter (Phillpotts) came to consecrate the  ‘beautiful church’. 

In the meantime, between the stone-laying and the consecration, the Parsonage house had been built, and, more than that, it was even  papered, furnished, and inhabited! Besides all this, there was a garden  made, and a doorway, after an ecclesiastical mode, leading into the  churchyard, with this inscription over it 

>‘Be true to Church, <BR>
Be kind to poor, <BR>
O minister, for evermore.’<BR> 

In this church there were super-altar, candles, triptych, and also a painted window organ, choir, and six bells so that for those days it was  considered a very complete thing. ‘The priest of Baldhu,’ with his  cassock and square cap, was quite a character in his small way. He  preached in a surplice, of course, and propounded Church tactics,  firmly contending for Church teaching. The Wesleyans and others had  their distinctive tenets, the Church must have hers they had their  members enrolled, the Church must have hers therefore he would  have a ‘guild’, with the view of keeping his people together. 

Outwardly there was an esprit de corps, and the parishioners came to church, and took an interest in the proceedings but it was easy to see  that their hearts were elsewhere. Still I went on, hoping against hope,  ‘building from the top’ without any foundation, teaching people to live  before they were born!
