# Individual Cases

### 1853

An Archbishop of Canterbury, in old times, contrasted public preaching with personal dealing in this way When we preach, it is like dashing water from a bucket upon so many vessels which are arranged before us - so drops fall into one, and some into another, while others remain empty but when we speak of individuals, it is like pouring water into the neck of a vessel.

I gave up writing and printing pamphlets, and went on as quietly as I could with my own work, looking out for individual cases as they presented themselves in the providence of God. In this way, without fomenting controversy or keeping up public excitement, I was able more effectually to impart my meaning, than by printed statements, which I found were misunderstood or distorted and what is more, I was able to apply the truth with an individual ‘Have you’? It would take more space than I can afford to tell of the souls which were gained in this way. I will give here only a few instances, which are interesting, and which will sustain the thread of my narrative.

The first was in the case of one who began an argument on Baptismal Grace. I asked him what it was. ‘I know what converting or saving grace is but what is this?’ He did not say more, than that in Baptism he was made a member of Christ, a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven.

But,’ I asked, ‘suppose you have not repented and believed, what then?’ Receiving no answer, I continued. ‘Then, nothing but the responsibility and the name.’

A few days afterwards he came to me, saying that I had made him quite miserable, and asked me whether I meant to deny the necessity of baptism. I said, ‘Certainly not, but the condition of faith and repentance must be fulfilled. Whatever Baptismal Regeneration may be, Spiritual Regeneration is the work of the Spirit in those who believe in Christ Jesus.’ After a long talk and prayer, he appeared to understand that a conscious change should be wrought in him, and a spiritual faculty imparted, by which ‘he could ‘see the kingdom of God’. He remained for the evening service and meeting in the schoolroom, and was much impressed with what he witnessed.

Instead of going away, he stayed with me till after midnight, when he found peace with God (as he said) in the church where we had been praying. Then he ordered his horse and rode home but before he set out, he exacted a promise from me that I would not mention his conversion to any one. I consented to this, on the condition that he announced the change which had been wrought in him, from his pulpit on the following Sunday.

A few days afterwards my friend came to me in a great rage, and charged me with announcing his conversion all over the town. I told him that I was not sure enough of it myself to say anything about it, and that I had not spoken to a single person on the subject. Still he seemed to doubt me, for he said his brother had been with him, and had told him that it was known all over the town that he had been to Baldhu, and that he was converted. Upon inquiry, I found out that my servant, who sat up till after midnight to get his horse, had overheard our conversation, and was the offending party.

I am always afraid of persons who are ashamed to acknowledge their conversion. My friend, I am sorry to say, made no announcement, but went on preaching as if he had always been the same, and consequently never came out to be of any use or help in the work. His testimony was indistinct also, and without any power. He became a very popular preacher afterwards, which was his great ambition, for he cared more for a large congregation than for winning souls.

Soon after this, I fell across another of my old friends in the street. He tried to avoid me, but I went up and shook hands with him. At first he would not look at me, and said he was afraid of me because I had changed my views. I assured him that I had not changed anything, but that I had myself been changed. As he was listening, I went on to tell him that I had long tried to make myself good enough for God’s acceptance, but finding that Christ would not receive reformed characters, I came to Him as a poor lost sinner, and He saved me.

Seeing that he continued attentive, I was proceeding to make my meaning plainer, when he turned round, and looking sternly at me, said, ‘If I understand you, I am to cry for mercy as “a common sinner”.’

‘Yes,’ I replied, being very pleased to find that he had understood me so well.

‘Then,’ he said, ‘I will do no such thing.’ With this he turned away and departed. When he saw that I was following him, he said, ‘I desire you will not speak to me any more. I do not agree with you.’

One morning, a short time after, I was praying and meditating in the church, when it came to my mind forcibly that I must go to this man’s parish. I rose from my knees forthwith, saying to myself that I would go but immediately the thought came to me, ‘This suggestion is not from God, for He must know that my horse has lost two shoes, and could not go all that distance.’ However, I returned home, and went to the stable to inquire, when, to my surprise, I found that my man had taken the horse out very early in the morning, and had got him properly shod. ‘He is all right for a long journey, master,’ he said, if you want to go.

‘Well,’ I said, ‘put on the saddle, and be ready in half-an-hour.’ I went in to prepare, and started in due time. On the way I was thinking what I would say, and how I would begin the conversation, for as yet I did not know the particular message I was to take.

When I arrived at my friend’s gate, I saw the marks of his horse’s feet, as if he had just gone out. However, I rode up to the front door, and rang the bell. His wife appeared, and said that her husband had gone out, and would not be back before six o clock she added, ‘You look disappointed’ and so I was, for I thought the Lord had sent me with some message to him. The lady kindly asked me to put up my horse, saying, ‘Perhaps he may return sooner you had better rest a little.’ I thanked her, and doing so, went in.

As soon as we were seated, the lady said, ‘I have been wishing to see you for a long time we have started more than once to visit you, when my husband’s courage has failed him, and we have returned. He says that he loves you still but, somehow, he is very much afraid of you.’

Then she went on to tell me that when they were removing from their late parish to where they now were, having sent all their furniture on, they were driving in their own carriage and that coming along over a bleak and desolate moor, the horse took fright at something, they knew not what, and ran away. Because it could not get along fast enough from its imaginary object of fear, it began to kick, and breaking the carriage in pieces, made its escape, leaving her and her husband on the ground. He was not much hurt, and soon rose, and came to help her. She was severely bruised, and her leg was broken besides. He managed to drag her gently to the side of the road, where there was a little bank, and, collecting some of the broken pieces of the carriage, he placed them round her for protection, and hurried off in order to get assistance. He had to go two miles, and was absent nearly three hours.

During that time she suffered great pain, but it came to her mind all at once that her sins were pardoned she was exceedingly happy, and could not help thanking and praising God. In this state her husband found her when he returned, and on hearing her talk, became very unhappy, because he thought that besides her leg, her head was broken too and that she was going out of her mind. She assured him over and over again, that she was wonderfully well, and really happy but he could not bear to hear her talk like that, and said that he should go mad also, if she did not stop.

During the six weeks she was laid up, he continually brought doctors and clergymen to talk her out of her delusion, as he thought, but without avail. Her happiness continued for several months, and then gradually died away. She asked me, ‘Can you tell me the meaning of this?’ I was deeply interested with her experience, and told her that I had read of a similar one only a few days before.

My heart now began to cheer up, for I saw why I had been sent to this place. I at once pointed her to passages of Scripture, where we are told that we have forgiveness of sins through the blood of Jesus, and I put Christ crucified before her as the object of faith. I told her, that as certainly as the blood of Jesus had been shed, there was mercy and forgiveness for her. I said, ‘I believe it, and have forgiveness and you may have it too not because you feel happy, but because Jesus died.’

She did believe, and we rejoiced together.

She exclaimed, ‘Oh that the Lord would change my husband’s heart, and bring you here for a revival!’

‘Very well,’ I said, ‘let us ask Him,’ and we did so. I then rode home praising God.

Before leaving, I promised to come again on the following Wednesday. I kept my word, and had an interview with her husband but it was not encouraging. He said he could not agree to ask for mercy as a sinner, because he had been baptized. Some months afterwards, his manservant came to me on horseback at three o’clock in the morning, to say that his master was very bad, and would I come as soon as possible and see him. I asked, ‘What is the matter?’ ‘Oh, bless the Lord,’ said the man, ‘it’s all about his soul!’ ‘That is right,’ I replied, thanking God ‘I will go with you at once,’ and immediately I saddled my horse, and rode back with him.

I found my friend was under deep conviction, and in the greatest misery he now thought that he was a most ‘uncommon sinner’, and that there was no mercy for him, there could not be any! After a time he acknowledged the power of God to forgive sin, and declared that he believed in Christ, and I was led to say, ‘he that believeth hath everlasting life.’ Upon this text he found peace, and we all praised God together.

The Sunday following, he asked the congregation to thank God with him for having saved his soul and in his sermon told them something of his experience. Subsequently his church became the centre of a work of God, as Mr. Aitken’s church and mine were in our respective neighbourhoods.

The power of the Lord overshadowed the place, and there was as usual a simultaneous melting of hearts all over the parish, and a running together of the people to hear the Word, and what is better to obey it. Then followed a true Cornish revival with full manifestations, and Mr. Aitken came to preach. The fire was burning and shining before but when this mighty man stirred it, it rose to a tremendous height. The excitement of the parson and people was intense, and hundreds of souls were added to the Church, who had been brought from the death of sin into the life of righteousness, which all the previous preaching on Baptism and the Lord’s Supper had failed to produce.
