# Cottage Meetings

### 1852

Our steps were now directed to another part of the parish, where we commenced a series of cottage meetings in alternation with services in the church. These meetings were inaugurated in a very remarkable manner, in the house of a man named ‘Frank’, who was well known as an exceedingly wicked and careless fellow. His wife was among the fruits of the revival, and prayed much for him but the more she did so, the worse he became. I used to try and comfort her with the thought that if he did not give himself to God to be made better, it was well that he got worse, for it was a proof that her prayers were telling total indifference would have been a far more discouraging sign.

This was poor comfort to her, however, for he came home night after night drunk or if not so, swearing about the revival in the church, and her praying. He often declared that if he ever caught me in his house, he would ‘give me something for myself’. He was at all times a very irascible man, and being troubled with a wooden leg, it made him worse. As he was unable to work in the mine, he was dependent for his support on the parish authorities, who employed him to break stones on the road.

Notwithstanding his bad temper and ill-feeling towards me, I always stopped at his heap of stones when passing, and talked to him either about the weather or some other trivial subject, being quite satisfied that he knew the plan of salvation, as I had spoken to him about his soul at the time of his wife’s conversion.

One day, when coming along, I observed Frank before me in the road, busy, as usual, breaking stones, and began to think what I would speak to him about, having no particular news to communicate. While I was thus pondering, I came to his place, when, to my great astonishment, he was not there. I looked around on all sides, and called, ‘Frank―Frank!’ but in vain―no one answered. There was no hedge or tree within sight for him to hide behind where could he be?  All at once, I remembered that there was a small gravel-pit about twenty-five or thirty yards from the spot, but scarcely thought it possible he could be there. I went towards it, however, still calling, ‘Frank―Frank!’ and yet received no answer. On looking in, sure enough, there was my man, lying down in the pit, close up to the side, with his face on the ground. I said, ‘Frank, is that you? What are you doing there? Are you ill?’

>‘No,’ he replied, ‘I’m not. What d’yer want with me?’

‘Nothing in particular,’ I said ‘but, to tell the truth, I was so surprised at your disappearance, that I could not pass on without looking for you. I was so sure that I saw you in the distance, sitting in your place and then, when I came up, you were not there. I wondered whether I had seen, your ghost instead of you, and whether you were dead, or what. Are you hiding away from me?’

Rising up, he said, ‘I had a terrible dream last night, which frightened me very much. A voice said, “Go and see Mr. Haslam about your soul.” I said, “I will, I will, the first thing in the morning.” When the morning came, I thought the evening would do and when I saw you coming, it made me tremble so, that I got up and hid myself here.’

I said, ‘Frank, it is no use for you to fight against God, or stand out against your wife’s prayers. You had far better give in.

He then told me that his dream referred to something in his past life, and sitting down on the bank or side of the gravel-pit, he said, ‘When I was ill with my leg (which was taken off), the doctor told me that I should die. I then cried to the Lord to have mercy on me, and said that if He would raise me up, I would give my heart to Him. I began to recover from that day, and kept on intending and intending to give my heart to God but I never did it. I got quite well in health, but ever since that time I have been getting worse and worse in mind. When my wife was converted, it seemed as if the devil took possession of me altogether, and the Lord warned me again last night.’

>‘Come now,’ I said, ‘you had better kneel down here and give up.’ It was a lonely road on a bare common. ‘Kneel down,’ I repeated, ‘and let us pray’.’ He did so, and after prayer he said, ‘By God’s help, I will give up.’

>‘No,’ I replied, ‘that will not do. Say, Lord, take my heart. “I do”―not “I will”―give up.’

After a short pause, he solemnly said, ‘I do Lord, take my heart!’ and then began to cry.

I gave him the text, ‘God so loved the world, that He gave His onlybegotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John iii. 16). ‘Think over that,’ I said, ‘and come to the schoolroom to-night.’ He did so, and was saved, to the great joy of his soul. After, the meeting was over, he remained behind a long time, and gave vent to his feelings with tears, when he remembered the goodness of God to him.

>‘This wooden leg of mine,’ he said, ‘is a monument of God’s mercy!’

>‘How is that?’ I inquired.

>‘Several ‘years ago,’ he said, ‘I was playing cards for money in a public-house, and was cheating in order to win, when the man I was playing with said, “You would not have won that money if you had not cheated.” I swore at him, and said, “God strike my limbs if I did so!” I knew I had and the man would not believe that I had not. So we parted.

>‘The next morning, I was working in the mine, close to a very large piece of rock, which had been loosened with the blasting, when it slipped from its place, and carried me along with it into the shaft. As the heavy end was uppermost, it turned with its own weight, and fell across the shaft, pinning me against the side. This rock was not less than two or three tons weight. Notwithstanding the fearful shock. I retained my senses but one leg was smashed, and the other severely wounded. “God struck my limbs!” I cried for help and when the men who were attracted by my screams found me, they saw at once that it was impossible to extricate me without moving the rock. There I remained for more than two hours, till they had put a sling round my body. Having done that, they adjusted a strong chain to the rock, and lifted the end. As soon as they succeeded in raising it, down it went, carrying plats, ladders, and all before it, to the bottom of the shaft, which was many fathoms deep, whilst I was left hanging in the sling. They then drew me up, and took me to the hospital, where one leg was taken off and the other set but I was very ill for a long time. Oh, just think, if that rock had not pinned my legs to the wall of the shaft, I should have been in hell now! The Lord saved my life then―and has saved my soul now!’

Dear Frank became a very zealous Christian., and for many years preached the Gospel with much power and acceptance. After his conversion, he came one morning to beg my pardon for having forbidden me his house, and to ask if I would come and hold a meeting there for his neighbours.

I did; and there was such a crowd inside, and also outside the house, and so much blessing, that I was not satisfied with one visit, but went again and again.

The place was most inconveniently full; they turned out the chairs and tables to make standing-room inside, and opened the windows and doors for the people to hear outside and sometimes, before the address was over, men and women cried aloud for mercy. We could not kneel down to pray―praying, singing, and hearing was done standing, and that very close together. The house was so uncomfortably thronged, that a miller in the neighbourhood, who had a large room in the mill, begged me to come and preach there instead. I accepted his invitation, and we went but, alas! there was no power there it was hard to pray or preach and the people were not even attentive. Thus it was dearly seen that it is not by might or by power of men, but by the Spirit of the Lord and that it the Lord was not present to work, no work was done. We went back to Frank’s cottage, and there again the manifest presence of God was discernible and every time we did so souls were saved.

Next door to Frank lived a tall, gaunt, gipsy kind of woman, whom they called ‘the wise woman’. She had a marvellous gift of healing, and other knowledge, which made people quite afraid of her. This woman took a great interest in me and my work, and often came to church, besides attending the meetings at Frank’s house.

One day, during these services, she paid a visit to the Parsonage, and said, ‘My dear, have you a lemon in the house?’

I went to inquire, and found that we had not.

‘Well, then,’ she said, ‘get one, and some honey and vinegar, and mix them all together. You will want it. Mind you do, now,’ she said, drawing herself up to her full height ‘mind you do, you will want it!’ Then she put the bowl of her pipe into the kitchen fire, and having ignited the tobacco, went away smoking.

The servants were much frightened by her manner and her warning, and begged me to get the lemon, saying, ‘It was about you, master it was about you that she came.’

I did not know where to get a lemon within three miles but it so happened that a man came to the door with a net full, for sale, that same afternoon. We bought two, just to pacify the servants, and let them make the mixture, thinking nothing more about it.

In the course of the afternoon a very heavy thunderstorm fell upon us, deluging the roads and lanes, and before it ceased I had to go to the meeting. I took the precaution to put on thick shoes, and then set off and walked through the rain. When I arrived at the cottage, I thought my feet felt wet but they were not cold, so that I soon forgot all about them, and went on with the meeting, which lasted till ten o’clock then I returned home. On taking off my shoes, I was surprised to see how wet and muddy my socks were. I had been standing with wet feet all the evening. To guard against any ill effects, I put my feet in hot water before going to bed. However, at three o’clock in the morning I awoke, nearly choked with a severe fit of bronchitis the thick, hard phlegm in my throat almost suffocated me I had to struggle for breath and life. After an hour or more of the most acute suffering, my dear wife remembered the lemon mixture, and called the servant to get up and bring it. It was just in time. I was black in the face with suffocation but this compound relieved, and, in fact, restored me. I was greatly exhausted with the effort and struggle for life, and after two hours I fell asleep. I was able to rise in the morning, and breathe freely, though my chest was very sore.

After breakfast, the ‘wise woman’ appeared, standing outside the window of the drawing-room, where I was lying on the sofa.

‘Ah, my dear,’ she said, ‘you were nearly gone at three o’clock this morning. I had a hard wrestle for you, sure enough. If you had not had that lemon, you know, you would have been a dead man by this time!’

That mysterious creature, what with her healing art, together with the prayer of faith and the marvellous foresight she had, was quite a terror to the people. One day she came, and bade me go to a man who was very worldly and careless, and tell him that he would die before Sunday.

I said, ‘You go, if you have received the message.’

She looked sternly at me, and said, ‘You go! that’s the message―you go!’

I went. The man laughed at me, and said, ‘That old hag ought to be hanged.’ I urged him to give his heart to God, and prayed with him, but to no effect. He was thrown from his cart, and killed the following Saturday, coming home from market.

Her sayings and doings would fill a book but who would believe the things?

She was not always a bird of evil omen, for sometimes she brought me good news as well as bad. One day she said, ‘There is a clergyman coming to see you, who used to be a great friend of yours, but since your conversion he has been afraid of you. He is coming you must allow him to preach he will be converted before long!’ Sure enough, my old friend, W. B., came as she predicted. He preached, and in due time was converted, and his wife also but his story shall come in its own place.

The work at Frank’s cottage stopped as suddenly as it began. I cannot theorize about the subject I merely state that so it was. It began, it continued and continued only in that house, and then it stopped.

Another remarkable thing may here be observed―that on visiting the cottages within a limited distance round Frank’s house, people were softened, and it was easy to persuade them to yield themselves to Christ. They appeared to be quite ripe and ready. Just beyond this limit the people were as hard and careless as ever. It seemed as if the power of God overshadowed only a certain spot, and that all within that were under Divine influence for the time, though all were not converted. They acknowledged, however, that they felt the Spirit’s power striving with them, and they knew afterwards that it was withdrawn. ‘The wind bloweth where it listeth.’
