# A Mission To The North 

### 1855

When my family were all comfortably settled and surrounded by kind friends, I went off to the north of England, on a visit to a clergyman, who had invited me. He had already suffered for doing this on a previous occasion, in the diocese of Oxford where the bishop took away his licence, because he had me to preach for him. The real cause of offence was, that there was a revival in the parish and complaint was made to the bishop, that people were kept up till ‘all hours of the night, howling and praying’. His lordship sent forthwith for my friend’s licence I advised him to send it, saying, ‘He will be sure to return it to you but perhaps with a reprimand.’ Instead of this, the bishop kept it, and said that he would countersign his testimonials to go to another diocese. My friend was at first disgusted and disposed to rebel but instead of this, he bore the treatment patiently and went to another position and charge at G---- , in the north of England.

Thither, nothing afraid, he invited me to come. In this part of the country I found a hearty lively people, something like the Cornish. Here I soon regained my spirits, and got to work in right earnest.

In this place a revival began at once and every day we had people crying for mercy, very much in the way they did in Cornwall. Among others, there came to the church on Sunday afternoon, a tall Yorkshireman, in his working clothes. He stood under the gallery, in his shirt sleeves, with a clay pipe sticking out of his waistcoat pocket, and a little cap on his head. I fancy I can see him now, standing erect, looking earnestly at me while I was preaching, with his hand on one of the iron supports of the gallery. As the sermon proceeded he became deeply interested, and step by step drew nearer to the pulpit. He seemed to be altogether unconscious that he was not dressed for a Sunday congregation, or that he was the object of any special notice.

After the sermon, he knelt down in the aisle, and there he remained. I was called out of the vestry to go to him, but could not get him to say a word. I prayed by his side, and after some time he groaned out an ‘Amen’, then he got up, and went towards the door. I followed him, and saw that instead of going along the path, he made across the graves in the churchyard, to a particular one and then he threw himself on the ground, in vehement and convulsive emotion. He said something about ‘Edward’, but we could not distinguish what it was. The sexton said, that this was his son Edward’s grave. Poor man! he was in great sorrow but he kept it all to himself. He then went home, and shut himself up in his own room. His daughter could do nothing with him in his distress. We called several times to see him in the course of the evening, but in vain.

The next morning I called again, when his daughter told me that he had gone out early, and had not returned to breakfast. She appeared to be in a good deal of trouble, and said she had been to his mine to inquire for him, but that he was not there. All day long we searched for him. Some looked in the woods, half-expecting they might find his body on the ground, or hanging from a tree while others inquired in every direction, with increasing anxiety, till the evening. Then, as we were returning home in despair and disappointment, whom should we see in the green lane between the vicarage and the church, but our friend. He was looking into the shrubs as if watching something and when we came up to him, he turned to us with a radiant smile, and said, ‘The Lord is “gude”.’

>I said, ‘You are right, He is so.’

>‘Yes, I am right, all right! thank God! Think of that! He saved me this day!’

>‘Are you coming to church tonight?’

>‘Oh yes, certainly I will be there.’

>‘But,’ I said, ‘have you been home yet?’

>‘Oh yes, sir, thank you my girl knows all about me.’

That man was so manifestly changed, and so filled with the Spirit, that his old worldly companions were afraid of him. The publican of the inn he used to frequent, was particularly so, and said he was frightened to be in the same room with him.

There was a great stir among the people in this place for the fear of the Lord had fallen on them, so that they were solemnized exceedingly, and many were converted.

The vicar being somewhat timid, began to be afraid of what was going on and wrote to ask counsel of a clerical neighbour at C---- , who answered his letter by inviting him to come over, and bring me with him. He said that he wanted me to preach in his church on the following Friday evening, adding, ‘I have already given notice, and also read parts of your letter in church. I am sure the people will come and hear this man I expect a large congregation. Be sure and bring him over do not disappoint me on any account!’

Accordingly, on the Friday, we appeared there, and in the evening I preached to a large and attentive assembly. Many were awakened, and some remained behind to be spoken with others, who were too shy to do so, went home and we heard the next morning that several had had no sleep or rest all night. Three men, whom we saw in the morning, had found peace. After this, we drove slowly back to G---- , but a messenger had arrived before us, and said that I must come back again with him, for the bills were already out that I would preach on Sunday and following days at C---- . The vicar was most reluctant to let me go, but under these circumstances, he at last consented so I went back in the carriage the messenger had brought for that purpose.

At the Sunday morning service, the manner and tone of the people, and their eager attention, implied that something was going to happen. There was a deeply solemn feeling in the church, both morning and evening, which made it very easy to preach. In the course of my sermon, I know not why, I was led to speak about the endless misery of hell and some who were present said I asserted, ‘That there was a great clock in hell, with a large dial, but no hands to mark the progress of time it had a pendulum which swung sullenly and slowly from side to side, continually saying, “Ever! never!” “Ever! never!”

This seemed to make a profound sensation among the people many stayed to the after-meeting―they would not go away until they had been spoken with. Among others, the churchwarden came to me in a very excited state, and said, ‘What ever made you say, “Now or never!―now or never!”?’ He was like one beside himself with emotion when he thought of the pendulum which I had described. ‘Now or never!―now or never!’ he kept on repeating to himself, till at last he went away. He was far too excited to talk of anything else, or to listen either. Later on in the evening, we were sent for to come in all haste to his house. There we found him in great trouble of mind, and afraid to go to bed. After talking to him for a short time, he went on to say that he had a strange thing to tell us―that that very morning he was lying in bed (he thought he was quite awake), and looking at a little picture of the crucifixion which was hanging over the fireplace. While doing so, he saw as plainly as possible some black figures of imps and devils walking along the mantelpiece with a ladder, which they placed against the wall, evidently for the purpose of removing this picture from its place. He watched them intently, and noticed that they seemed much troubled and perplexed as to how they were to accomplish their task. Some of the imps put their shoulders to the under side of the frame, while others went up the ladder one, in particular, mounted to the top with great dexterity, to get the cord off the nail, but without success. Enraged at this, they made various other attempts, but all in vain, and at last gave up in despair, if not something worse for by this time they appeared furious, and dashed the ladder down to the ground, as if it were the fault of it, and not of themselves. In rage and disappointment, they passed off the scene.

Presently the bedroom door opened, as he thought, and who should present himself but ‘Paul Pry’ (that was the name he had given to a Dissenting preacher in the village, who was a portly man, and always went about with a thick umbrella under his arm)―the veritable Paul Pry, umbrella and all, standing at the door. He said to his visitor, ‘What do you want here?’ The phantom pointed to the picture over the mantelpiece, and said, in a quiet, confiding way, ‘Now or never! Do you hear, man? Now or never!’ The man was indignant at this untimely intrusion, and bade his visitor begone but, for all that he still stood at the door, and said, ‘Now or never!―now or never!’ He got out of bed, and went towards the door, but the figure disappeared, saying, ‘Now or never!―now or never!’

Then he got into bed again, and all was still for a little while, when suddenly the door opened a second time, and the vicar appeared, just as Paul Pry had done and came towards the bed, as if with a friendly and affectionate concern for his welfare, and said, ‘My dear fellow, be persuaded―it is “now or never!” Then, taking a seat at the corner of the bed, with his back leaning against the post, he went on talking, and saying, again and again, ‘Now or never!’

The poor churchwarden remonstrated in vain against being visited in this manner, and thought it very hard but the vicar sat there, and persistently said, ‘Now or never!’ He became very angry, and bade him go out of the room immediately but the vicar said, ‘Now or never!’

‘I will “now” you,’ he said, ‘if you do not be off!’ and so saying he rose up in his bed while the vicar glided to the door, repeating, ‘Now or never!’ and went away. The poor man, in great distress of mind, turned to his wife, and asked her what could be the meaning of all this but she only cried, and said nothing.

Then, who should come next but Mr. F---- , a quiet man of few words.

He had thoughts, no doubt, but kept them all to himself. He came gliding into the room, as the vicar had done, sat on the same corner of the bed, leant against the same post, and in the quietest way possible repeated the same words, ‘Now or never!’

>‘Do you hear him’?’ said the poor distracted man to his wife―‘do you hear him?’

>‘Hear him? Hear what? No! nonsense! What does he say?’

>‘My dear, there! listen!’

>‘Now or never!’ said the quiet man.

>‘There, did you not hear that?’

>‘No,’ she said, ‘I can hear nothing,’ and began to cry more copiously.

He got up, and said he would take the poker and punish every one of them―that he would. The strange visitor made for the door, and, like all the rest, said, as he disappeared, ‘Now or never!’

The poor churchwarden continued in a most distracted state, and during the day met all his three visitors who had caused him so much anxiety―‘Paul Pry’, the vicar, and the quiet gentleman, none of whom looked at him or spoke to him as if anything had happened but when he heard me say over and over again in the pulpit, “Now or never!’ pointing, as it were, to the ghostly pendulum swinging there saying, ‘Ever!―never!’ and inquiring of the people, ‘Do you see it? Do you hear it? it seemed to bring matters to a climax. He said he turned and looked at the wall to which I pointed, and almost expected to see that solemn clock.

I did not wait to hear more, but kneeling down, I begged him to close with the offer of salvation ‘Now’. ‘No,’ he said, with a sigh, ‘I am afraid I have refused too long!’

‘Don’t say so! take it at once, “now” or perhaps it will be “never” with you.’ A man does not often get such a plain warning as you have had. You had better take care what you are doing. “Now”! why not “now”?’ He did accept salvation, and yielding himself to God, received forgiveness of his sins and after that became a very different man.

He had, as may have been suspected from the above narrative, the besetment of drink, before his conversion, and it remained a trouble to him after. Conversion and forgiveness of sins do not put away present bad habits. Such a master habit as this requires a direct dealing with.

Zaccheus was a man who had been led astray by the love of money when he was saved,, he put his idol away from him at a stroke. This is the first thing to be done and if it is done in the power of one’s first love, it is a more easy task than afterwards. But it must be done with a firm and whole heart not ‘Lord, shall I give the half of my goods to feed the poor?’ but, ‘Lord, behold, the half of my goods I do give.’ ‘Behold, Lord, I do give up the world, here, now.’ ‘Behold, Lord, I do here, and now, give up drink, and will totally abstain from it henceforth.’ This is the first step and the next is not less important, and that is to carry out the determination in the Lord’s power, and not in our own. The resolution and determination once made, must be given over to the Lord to be kept by Him not by our own effort and energy, but with perfect distrust of self and in dependence upon Him to enable us to keep it. Without this, there is no security whatever for anything more than temporary success, too often succeeded by a sorrowful fall. The flesh is too strong for us, and even if it were not so, the devil is these two together, besides the lax example of the world, are sure to overpower the weak one. Young Christians need to put away at once the sin, whatever it is, that ‘so easily besets’ them, or they will be entangled by it. There is no real and thorough deliverance, except by renouncing sin, and self too, giving up and yielding to the Lord. That soul was saved but it was a miserable bondage of fear in which he lived and died. He was brought home at last, like a wrecked ship into harbour, who might have come in with a good freight, a happy welcome, and an ‘abundant entrance’.

The next day, Monday, we heard of other cases which were ordinary in their character, and therefore need not be detailed but in the evening there was one which it will be instructive to mention.

It was that of a clergyman of private means, who came to this parish as a curate but he had given up ‘taking duty’, because, he said, ‘it was all humbug reading prayers, and all that.’ He drove a tandem, and smoked all day instead nevertheless, he was the object of much and earnest prayer. He also happened to be at church the day I preached about the clock and declared likewise that I said there was a clock in hell. The sermon had evidently made a great impression upon him. He came to church again the next day, and heard something else that he was unable to forget. After the service, as soon as I was free, he asked me to walk with him, to which I assented, though I was feeling very tired. We rambled on the beach, and talked about many things. I tried in vain to bring up the subject of my discourse. When I spoke about it, he was silent and when I was silent, he went off into other matters. He talked about Jerusalem and the sands of the desert, and the partridges, which, he said, were of the same colour as the sand. Was it from looking at sand always that they became that colour? Do people become alike who look much at one another? Is that why husbands and wives so often resemble each other? and so on. These questions made an impression on me, so that they always come up to my memory in connection with that evening’s walk. Certainly, the apostle says that, ‘Beholding the glory of the Lord, we are changed into the same image from glory to glory!’ therefore there may be something in my companion’s idea. But, however interesting the subject might be to consider, I was far too tired for anything else but real soul-to-soul work, and therefore proposed that we should return home. We did so and when my friend left me at the vicarage door, he said abruptly, ‘Will you let me write to you?’

>‘Certainly,’ I replied.

>‘I will write to-night but do not trouble to answer in person send me a written reply.’

I said I would. In a few minutes after I received a short note, the purport of which was, ‘How can I be saved?’ It is a very, simple question, yet one not so easily answered to a person who already knew the scriptural answer. However, I had a letter by me which Mr. Aitken had written to some one under similar circumstances so, taking that for a model, I wrote according to promise, adapting and altering sentences to meet the present case. I sent the note, with a message that I would call in the morning. I did so, but found my friend was not at home. The landlady said, ‘Mr. F went out last night soon after he received a letter, and has not been home since.’ She became alarmed when she heard that we had not seen him. We too were taken by surprise, and did not know which way to go in search of him, or what to do. Presently we met the clerk of the church, who inquired if we had seen anything of Mr. F he had called the night before for the keys of the church, and had not returned them so he (the clerk) could not get into the church to ring the bell or admit the congregation.

This threw some light on the matter so we went immediately to the church, and with the vicar’s keys entered by the vestry door. Looking about in all directions, we found our friend on his knees in the nave, where he had been all night. I went up to him, and, as he did not speak, I asked if I might pray with him.

>He said, ‘Yes.’

>‘What shall I pray for?’

>‘I don’t know.’

>‘Shall I asked the Lord to come down from heaven again and die on the cross for you?’

>‘No.’

>‘Do you believe that He has done that?’

>‘Yes, I do.’

>‘You do believe that He has died for you―for you?’ I inquired, laying the emphasis on you―‘for you, as if you were the only person for whom He died?’

>‘Yes I believe He died for me.’

>‘Do you thank Him for it?’

>‘No, I do not I do not feel anything.’

>‘That may be but do you not think you ought to thank Him for what He did for you?’

He did not reply.

>‘How can you feel anything till you have it? or how can He give you any feelings till you thank Him for what He has already done for you? Make some acknowledgment.’

>‘Thank you’ he replied and without another word he rose from his knees and went away.

The bell was rung, the people assembled, and we had the service but he did not remain.

Again he disappeared for the whole day, until the evening, when he came into the vestry, and said, ‘Will you let me read prayers this evening?’ To this the vicar gladly assented so he put on the surplice for the first time after several months, and went into church with us. The fact of his reading prayers again, and more especially the manner in which he did it, attracted attention. The earnest tone and meaning he threw into the words of the prayers, and more particularly into the psalm, penetrated much deeper. One lady knelt down and began to pray for herself in the pew others were riveted as by the power of the Spirit. All through the sermon, I felt that the Lord was working among the people, and at the close they were loth to go. Many more remained in the after-meeting than we could speak to manifest was the power of the Spirit, and much good was done.

There was great joy in the little village that night, and for several days following the Lord wrought among the people. Many lasting mementos remain of this week’s ministry, and of the weeks which followed.

Our reticent friend was changed indeed, and immediately gave up the tandem and the pipes. I do not think he has ever smoked since he has had something better to do.

Smoking is an idle custom, and too often enslaves its votaries and even if it does not become a dominant habit, it certainly teaches no lesson of self-denial. A Christian man needs not to seek relief in any such way. It is said to be very soothing when a man is in any trouble or anxiety if so, in this respect it may be said to be next door to the beer-barrel, or to the use of spirits. If one man may soothe his feelings with this narcotic, another may stimulate them, when he is low and cheerless, with alcohol. The Apostle James says, ‘Is any merry, let him sing psalms.’ He does not say, Is any afflicted or low, let him smoke and drink! No ‘let him pray,’ and depend upon God. Many a lesson which might be learned from God on our knees, is let slip altogether because we think there is no harm in relieving ourselves by self-indulgence. The flesh is a monster which is never appeased, much less subdued, by gratification..

Our friend put away the smoking, and sold his pipes of various kinds, which must have cost a considerable sum, for he realized eighty pounds by them. With this amount, and some addition, he was able to put stained glass windows into the already beautiful church, in which he received his blessing. This suitable thank-offering was a lasting memorial of his gratitude, besides being an example to others, not only to give their hearts to God, but also to give up their besetments, whatever they might be, and in doing so be free for God’s service.

This young man soon after was removed to a more arduous sphere, and carried great blessing thither as he did also when he went from thence to a yet more influential and important place. Though now laid aside by ill health, he sends tracts and writes letters to many, and so continues to be, in the hand of the Lord, the means of winning souls and in addition to this, sets an example of a holy and godly life. Another little incident I must notice here. While I was still working in this place, I received a letter from home, telling me that they were all well, and very happy in the country, but that they wanted me back again, and thought I had been away quite long enough. Besides this, it was time to be getting summer things, for which they would want at least ten pounds. I had no money to send and though I might have asked many kind friends, I felt a difficulty about it. I do not think it was pride. I had put myself and all my affairs into God’s hands and though I was not ashamed to tell our circumstances to any one who asked me, I made it a rule not to mention my troubles or wants to any but the Lord. I read the cheerful parts of my letter at breakfast, and kept the other till I went upstairs.

There, I spread the letter on the bed at which I knelt, and read to the Lord the part that troubled me. I was praying about it, when there came a knock at the door, and before I had time to say ‘Come in’, my friend F entered. Seeing me on my knees, he apologized for intruding, and in his shy way put a ten-pound note into my hand, saying, ‘I am ashamed it is not more but will you accept that?’

With this, he made for the door but I detained him, in order to show him the part of my letter I had not read in the morning. I said, ‘I was just reading it to the Lord and look, while I was still on my knees, He has sent you with the answer. It is the exact sum I want, so do not apologize for it. I thank God and thank you. I will send this off at once.
