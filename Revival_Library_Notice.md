## About This Book 
William Haslam has the unique testimony of being converted in the midst of one of his own sermons! Haslam, born in 1817, began his ministry after graduating from Durham University in 1841, in the diocese of Exeter. 

After a brief curacy he became vicar at Baldhu church where the congregation were predominantly revivalist Methodists. The retelling of their conversion experiences drove him to seek counsel from a nearby vicar by the name of Robert Aitken, who persuaded him of the absolute necessity of conversion. 

It was on his return to his home church that he preached a sermon on the subject of conversion during which he obtained an assurance of salvation himself! The immediate results were so evident that a Methodist local preacher in the congregation shouted out, ‘The Parson is converted!’ This was in 1851. 

Thereafter Haslam adopted the Methodist revivalistic approach and saw local revivals in a number of his parishes over the next few years. This book records his work up to the end of his ministry in Hayle, Cornwall in 1861.
